listings. But 31 have empty language attributes (language="") 
and throw csspdf warnings.

** At the author's request, I added some CSS in the oneoff for 
special rendering of URLs above code examples. The CSS hooks on 
this XML markup:

<para role="sourcecode">

** A few long code lines.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems 
for which we can help automate a fix.

Notes from Dan:
===============
Tools: please update the Code and Safari Preface sections.

[Done at intake.--TOOLS]

Tools/Prod: a note from Andy: The authors have been communicating 
with the Tools group about the layout of the examples.

[See my note about the CSS above.--TOOLS]

Otherwise, this looks pretty okay.

No artwork.

Thanks,
