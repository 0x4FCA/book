  ABSTRACT = {This paper reports on the development and formal certification (proof
of semantic preservation) of a compiler from Cminor (a C-like
imperative language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the Coq proof
assistant both for programming the compiler and for proving its
correctness.  Such a certified compiler is useful in the context of
formal methods applied to the certification of critical software: the
certification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as well.}

We give its abstract syntax, type system, well-formedness conditions, and an operational evaluation semantics. Based on these definitions, we can express soundness of the type system, an important design goal claimed to be reached by the designers of Java, and prove that Bali is indeed type-safe. All definitions and proofs have been done formally in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Thus this article demonstrates that machine-checking the design of non-trivial programming languages has become a reality.}, CRClassification = {D.3.1, F.3.2}, CRGenTerms = {Languages, Security, Verification} }
