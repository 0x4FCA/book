    <title>Why OCaml?</title>
    <para>
      The programming languages that you use affect the software you
      create. They influence your software's reliability, security and
      efficiency, and how easy it is to read, refactor, and extend. The
      languages you know can also deeply affect how you think about
      programming and software design.
    </para>
    <para>
      But not all ideas about how to design a programming language are
      created equal. Over the last 40 years, a few key language features
      have emerged that together form a kind of sweet-spot in language
      design. These features include:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Garbage collection</emphasis> for automatic memory
          management, now a feature of almost every modern high-level
          language.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Higher-order functions</emphasis> that can be passed
          around as first-class values, as seen in Javascript or Scala.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Static type-checking</emphasis> to reduce run-time
          errors, such as Java or Scala interfaces or variable type
          declarations in C#, Ada and Pascal.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Generics</emphasis> to enable abstractions to be
          constructed across different datatypes, available as C++
          templates or in Java or C#.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Immutable data structures</emphasis> that cannot be
          destructively updated, famously enforced in Haskell but also a
          common feature of many distributed big data frameworks.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Algebraic datatypes</emphasis> and <emphasis>pattern
          matching</emphasis> to define and manipulate complex data
          structures, available in Miranda, F# and Standard ML.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>Automatic type inference</emphasis> to avoid having
          to laboriously define the type of every single variable in a
          program, and instead have them inferred based on how a value
          is used. Available in Standard ML, F# and even modern C++11
          via its <literal>auto</literal> keyword.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Some of you will know and love these features, and others will be
      completely new to them. Most of you will have seen
      <emphasis>some</emphasis> of them in other languages that you've
      used. As we'll demonstrate over the course of this book, it turns
      out that there is something transformative about having them all
      together and able to interact in a single language. Despite their
      importance, these ideas have made only limited inroads into
      mainstream languages. And when they do arrive there, like
      higher-order functions in C# or parametric polymorphism in Java,
      it's typically in a limited and awkward form. The only languages
      that support these ideas well are statically-typed functional
      programming languages like OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala and Standard
      ML.
    </para>
    <para>
      Among this worthy set of languages, OCaml stands apart because it
      manages to provide a great deal of power while remaining highly
      pragmatic. The compiler has a straightforward compilation strategy
      without excessive optimization passes, and the strict evaluation
      model makes runtime behaviour easy to predict. The garbage
      collector is an incremental, precise implementation with no
      dynamic JIT compilation, and the runtime is simple and portable
      across platforms. It is all of this that makes OCaml a great
      choice for programmers who want to step up to a better programming
      language, and at the same time want to get practical work done.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="a-brief-history-from-the-1960s">
      <title>A brief history from the 1960s</title>
      <para>
        OCaml was written in 1996 by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon,
        Damien Doligez and Didier Rémy at INRIA in France. It was
        inspired by a long line of research into ML starting in the
        1960s, and continues to have deep links to the academic
        community.
      </para>
      <para>
        ML was originally the <emphasis>meta language</emphasis> of the
        LCF proof assistant released by Robin Milner in 1972 (at
        Stanford, and later at Cambridge). ML was turned into a compiler
        in order to make it easier to use LCF on different machines, and
        gradually turned into a fully fledged system of its own by the
        1980s.
      </para>
      <para>
        In 1990, Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez built a new
        implementation called Caml Light that was based on a bytecode
        interpreter with a fast sequential garbage collector. Over the
        next few years useful libraries appeared, such as Michel Mauny's
        parsing system. Efficiency further improved with a fast native
        code compiler that made OCaml's performance competitive with
        mainstream languages such as C++. A module system inspired by
        Standard ML also provided powerful facilities for abstraction
        and larger scale programs.
      </para>
      <para>
        The modern OCaml emerged in 1996, when a powerful and elegant
        object system was implemented by Didier Rémy and Jérôme
        Vouillon. This object system was notable for supporting many
        common OO idioms in a statically type-safe way, whereas the same
        idioms required runtime checks in languages such as C++ or Java.
        In 2000, Jacques Garrique extended OCaml with several new
        features such as polymorphic methods and variants and labelled
        and optional arguments.
      </para>
      <para>
        The last decade has seen OCaml attract a significant user base,
        and language improvements have been steadily added to support
        the growing codebases that use the language both commercially
        and for academic use. First-class modules, Generalized Algebraic
        Data Types (GADTs) and dynamic linking have improved the
        flexibility of the language, and there is fast native code
        support for x86_64, ARM, PowerPC and Sparc64, making OCaml a
        good choice for systems where resource usage, predictability and
        performance matters.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="the-core-standard-library">
      <title>The Core Standard Library</title>
      <para>
        A language on its own isn't enough. You also need a rich set of
        libraries to base your applications on. A common source of
        frustration for those learning OCaml is that the standard
        library that ships with the compiler doesn't provide a lot of
        features. The standard library was actually developed for use
        within the compiler itself, and by design covers only a small
        subset of the functionality you expect for more general-purpose
        use.
      </para>
      <para>
        In the world of open-source software, nothing stops alternative
        libraries from being written to supplement the compiler standard
        library, and this exactly what the Core distribution is. Jane
        Street, a company that has been using OCaml for more than a
        decade, developed Core for its own internal use, but it was
        designed from the start with an eye towards being a
        general-purpose standard library, and has very broad
        applicability. Core is also engineered with correctness,
        reliability and performance very much in mind.
      </para>
      <para>
        Core is also distributed with syntax extensions which provide
        useful new functionality to OCaml, and there are additional
        libraries such as the Async network communications library that
        extend the reach of Core into building complex distributed
        systems. All of these libraries are distributed under a liberal
        Apache 2 license to permit free use in hobby, academic and
        commercial settings.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you've learnt some OCaml before, this book may surprise you
        with some differences from your past experience. The Core
        standard library redefines most of the standard modules to be
        much more consistent, and so you'll need to adapt older code. We
        believe the Core model is worth learning; it's been successfully
        used on large, million-line codebases, and removes a big barrier
        to more widespread OCaml adoption. There will always exist code
        that uses only the compiler standard library of course, but
        there are other online resources available to learn that. Real
        World OCaml focuses on the techniques the authors have used in
        their personal experience to construct scalable, robust computer
        systems.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="the-ocaml-platform">
      <title>The OCaml Platform</title>
      <para>
        Core is comprehensive and effective standard library, but
        there's a lot more out there than Core. A large community of
        programmers have been using OCaml since its first release in
        1996 and have generated a lot of useful libraries and tools. In
        Real World OCaml, we'll introduce some of these libraries for
        you to experiment with realistic examples. The installation and
        management of these third-party libraries is made much easier
        via a package management tool known as OPAM. We'll explain more
        about OPAM as the book unfolds, but it forms the basis of the
        Platform, which is a set of tools and libraries that, along with
        the OCaml compiler, let you build realistic applications quickly
        and effectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another big improvement over the standard library is the
        <literal>utop</literal> command-line interface. This is a modern
        interactive tool that supports command history, macro expansion,
        module completion, and other niceties that make it much more
        pleasant to work with the language. We'll be using
        <literal>utop</literal> throughout the book instead of the
        normal OCaml toplevel. It can, of course, be installed using
        OPAM, and <xref linkend="installation"/> guides you
        through that process.
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="about-this-book">
    <title>About this book</title>
    <para>
      Real World OCaml is aimed at programmers who have some experience
      with conventional programming languages, but not specifically with
      <emphasis>statically-typed functional programming</emphasis>. The
      world of dynamic scripting languages such as Javascript, Ruby and
      Python have all adopted healthy elements of functional
      programming, but not all of it. Real World OCaml takes you through
      the full lifecycle of how to construct software with static
      typing, including the powerful module system that makes code
      re-use so much more robust.
    </para>
    <para>
      At the same time, OCaml is not Haskell. It takes a much more
      pragmatic approach by being strictly evaluated by default and
      permitting arbitrary side-effects. In fact, you can write OCaml
      code that looks very similar to imperative C but remains
      completely type-safe. One of the major strengths of OCaml for
      systems programming is that, with some experience, you can predict
      the runtime behaviour of a block of code very easily, with very
      little compiler magic involved. We'll explain some of these tricks
      to you as we go through the book and gradually introduce more
      complex concepts.

    <sect2 id="what-to-expect">
      <title>What to expect</title>
      <para>
        Real World OCaml is split into three parts and appendices:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Part I covers the basic concepts you'll need to know when
            building OCaml programs. You won't need to memorise all of
            this (objects, for example, are used rarely in practice),
            but understanding the concepts and examples is important.
            This part opens up with a guided tour to give you a quick
            overview of the language. It then moves onto modules,
            functors and objects, which may take some time to digest.
            Persevere though; even though these concepts may be
            difficult at first, they will put you in good stead even
            when switching to other languages, many of which have drawn
            inspiration from ML.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Part II builds on the basics by working through complete
            examples. Here you'll pick up useful techniques for building
            networked systems, as well as functional design patterns
            that help combine different features of the language to good
            effect. The focus throughout this section is on networked
            systems, and among other examples we'll build a running
            example that will perform Internet queries using the
            DuckDuckGo search engine.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Part III is all about understanding the runtime system in
            OCaml. It's a remarkably simple system in comparison to
            other language runtimes (such as Java or the .NET CLR), and
            you'll need to read this to build very high performance
            systems that have to minimise resource usage or interface to
            C libraries. This is also where we talk about profiling and
            debugging techniques using tools such as GNU
            <literal>gdb</literal> and <literal>gprof</literal>.
            Contributing your code back to the community is also
            important (if only to get bug fixes from other people!), and
            this part also explains how to do this via OPAM and GitHub.

      <para>
        Real World OCaml uses some tools that we've developed while
        writing this book. Some of these resulted in improvements to the
        OCaml compiler, which means that you will need to ensure that
        you have an up-to-date development environment (using the 4.01.0
        compiler). We've automated everything you need via the OPAM
        package manager, so please do follow the installation
        instructions in <xref linkend="installation"/>
        carefully.

        At this stage, the Windows operating system is also unsupported,
        and only Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD can be expected to
        work reliably. We realize this is a concern; there are no
        fundamental barriers to Windows support, but we're focussed on
        getting the main content finished before getting stuck into the
        porting effort.

  <title>A Guided Tour</title>
  <para>
    This chapter gives an overview of OCaml by walking through a series
    of small examples that cover most of the major features of the
    language. This should give a sense of what OCaml can do, without
    getting too deep in any one topic.
  </para>
  <para>
    We'll present this guided tour using the Core standard library and
    the <literal>utop</literal> OCaml toplevel, a shell that lets you
    type in expressions and evaluate them interactively.
    <literal>utop</literal> is an easier-to-use version of the standard
    toplevel (which you can start by typing <literal>ocaml</literal> at
    the command line). These instructions will assume you're using
    <literal>utop</literal> specifically.
  </para>
  <para>
    Before getting started, do make sure you have a working OCaml
    installation and toplevel as you read through this chapter so you
    can try out the examples.
  </para>
  <note>
  <title>
  Installing <literal>utop</literal>
  </title>
  <para>
    The easiest way to get the examples running is to set up the OPAM
    package manager, which is explained in
    <xref linkend="installation"/>. In a nutshell, you need to
    have a working C compilation environment and the PCRE library
    installed, and then:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
$ opam init
$ opam switch 4.01.0dev+trunk
$ opam install utop core_extended
$ eval `opam config -env`
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Note that the above commands will take some time to run. When
    they're done, create a file called <literal>~/.ocamlinit</literal>
    in your home directory:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
#use &quot;topfind&quot;
#camlp4o
#thread
#require &quot;core.top&quot;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Then type in <literal>utop</literal>, and you'll be in an
    interactive toplevel environment. OCaml phrases are only evaluated
    when you enter a double semicolon (<literal>;;</literal>), so you
    can split your typing over multiple lines. You can exit
    <literal>utop</literal> by pressing <literal>control-D</literal> and
    return. For complete instructions, please refer to
    <xref linkend="installation"/>.

      the <literal>Core.Std</literal> module to get access to Core's

          We needed to type <literal>;;</literal> in order to tell the

          peculiarity of the toplevel that is not required in
          stand-alone programs (though it is sometimes helpful to
          include <literal>;;</literal> to improve OCaml's error

          OCaml allows you to place underscores in the middle of your
          integer literals, as a way of improving readability. Note that

          just every three digits.

          OCaml carefully distinguishes between
          <literal>float</literal>, the type for floating point numbers
          and <literal>int</literal> the type for integers. The types
          have different literals (<literal>6.</literal> instead of
          <literal>6</literal>) and different infix operators
          (<literal>+.</literal> instead of <literal>+</literal>), and
          OCaml doesn't automatically cast between types. This can be a
          bit of a nuisance, but it has its benefits, since it prevents
          some kinds of bugs that arise in other languages due to
          unexpected differences between the behavior of
          <literal>int</literal> and <literal>float</literal>.

      We can also create a variable to name the value of a given
      expression, using the <literal>let</literal> keyword (also known
      as a <emphasis>let binding</emphasis>).
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let x = 3 + 4;;
val x : int = 7
# let y = x + x;;
val y : int = 14
</programlisting>
    <para>
      After a new variable is created, the toplevel tells us the name of
      the variable (<literal>x</literal> or <literal>y</literal>), in
      addition to its type (<literal>int</literal>) and value
      (<literal>7</literal> or <literal>14</literal>).

      The <literal>let</literal> syntax can also be used for creating
      functions.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let square x = x * x ;;

      Functions in OCaml are values like any other, which is why we bind
      one to a variable using the same <literal>let</literal> keyword
      used for binding a variable to a simple value such as an integer.
    </para>
    <para>
      When using <literal>let</literal> to define a function, the first
      identifier after the <literal>let</literal> is the function name,
      and each subsequent identifier is a different argument to the
      function. Thus, <literal>square</literal> is a function with a
      single argument. If no arguments are given, then we just have the
      ordinary definition of a variable that we saw earlier.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now that we're creating more interesting values like functions,
      the types have gotten more interesting too.
      <literal>int -&gt; int</literal> is a function type, in this case
      indicating a function that takes an <literal>int</literal> and
      returns an <literal>int</literal>. We can also write functions
      that take multiple arguments. (Note that the following example
      will not work if you haven't opened <literal>Core.Std</literal>.)
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

     Float.of_int x /. Float.of_int y

    <para>
      As a side note, the above is our first use of OCaml modules. Here,
      <literal>Float.of_int</literal> refers to the
      <literal>of_int</literal> function contained in the
      <literal>Float</literal> module, and not, as you might expect from
      an object-oriented language, accessing a method of an object. The
      <literal>Float</literal> module in particular contains
      <literal>of_int</literal> as well as many other useful functions
      for dealing with floats.
    </para>
    <para>
      The notation for the type-signature of a multi-argument function
      may be a little surprising at first, but we'll explain where it
      comes from when we get to function currying in
      <xref linkend="multi-argument-functions"/>. For the
      moment, think of the arrows as separating different arguments of
      the function, with the type after the final arrow being the return
      value. Thus, <literal>int -&gt; int -&gt; float</literal>
      describes a function that takes two <literal>int</literal>
      arguments and returns a <literal>float</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can even write functions that take other functions as
      arguments. Here's an example of a function that takes three
      arguments: a test function and two integer arguments. The function
      returns the sum of the integers that pass the test.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let sum_if_true test first second =
    (if test first then first else 0)
    + (if test second then second else 0)
  ;;
val sum_if_true : (int -&gt; bool) -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      If we look at the inferred type signature in detail, we see that
      the first argument is a function that takes an integer and returns
      a boolean, and that the remaining two arguments are integers.
      Here's an example of this function in action.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let even x =
    x mod 2 = 0 ;;
val even : int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
# sum_if_true even 3 4;;
- : int = 4
# sum_if_true even 2 4;;
- : int = 6
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that in the definition of <literal>even</literal> we used
      <literal>=</literal> in two different ways: once as the part of
      the let binding that separates the thing being defined from its
      definition; and once as an equality test, when comparing
      <literal>x mod 2</literal> to <literal>0</literal>. These are very
      different operations despite the fact that they share some syntax.

        As the types we encounter get more complicated, you might ask

        OCaml determines the type of an expression using a technique
        called <emphasis>type inference</emphasis>, by which it infers
        the type of a given expression based on what it already knows
        about the types of other related variables, and on constraints
        on the types that arise from the structure of the code.

            <literal>x</literal> must be the same type as
            <literal>0</literal>, which is <literal>int</literal>. By

        Over time, you'll build a rough intuition for how the OCaml
        inference engine works, which makes it easier to reason through
        your programs. One way of making it easier to understand the
        types is to add explicit type annotations. These annotations
        never change the behavior of an OCaml program, but they can
        serve as useful documentation, as well as catch unintended type
        changes. Here's an annotated version of
        <literal>sum_if_true</literal>:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let sum_if_true (test : int -&gt; bool) (x : int) (y : int) : int =
     (if test x then x else 0)
     + (if test y then y else 0)

val sum_if_true : (int -&gt; bool) -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In the above, we've marked every argument to the function with
        its type, with the final annotation indicating the type of the
        return value. Such type annotations can actually go around any
        value in an OCaml program, and can be useful for figuring out
        why a given program is failing to compile.

        Sometimes, there isn't enough information to fully determine the
        concrete type of a given value. Consider this function:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let first_if_true test x y =
    if test x then x else y
  ;;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        <literal>first_if_true</literal> takes as its arguments a
        function <literal>test</literal>, and two values,
        <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal>, where
        <literal>x</literal> is to be returned if
        <literal>test x</literal> evaluates to <literal>true</literal>,
        and <literal>y</literal> otherwise. So what's the type of
        <literal>first_if_true</literal>? There are no obvious clues
        such as arithmetic operators or literals to tell you what the
        type of <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal> are. That
        makes it seem like one could use this
        <literal>first_if_true</literal> on values of any type. Indeed,
        if we look at the type returned by the toplevel:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
val first_if_true : ('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        we see that rather than choose a single concrete type, OCaml has
        introduced a <emphasis>type variable</emphasis>
        <literal>'a</literal> to express that the type is generic. In
        particular, the type of the <literal>test</literal> argument is
        <literal>('a -&gt; bool)</literal>, which means that test is a
        one-argument function whose return value is
        <literal>bool</literal>, and whose argument could be of any type
        <literal>'a</literal>. But, whatever type <literal>'a</literal>
        is, it has to be the same as the type of the other two
        arguments, <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal>, and of
        the return value of <literal>first_if_true</literal>. This kind
        of genericity is called <emphasis>parametric
        polymorphism</emphasis>, and is very similar to generics in C#
        and Java.
      </para>
      <para>
        The generic type of <literal>first_if_true</literal> allows us
        to write:
      </para>

      <para>
        Both <literal>long_string</literal> and
        <literal>big_number</literal> are functions, and each is passed
        to <literal>first_if_true</literal> with two other arguments of
        the appropriate type (strings in the first example, and integers
        in the second). But we can't mix and match two different
        concrete types for <literal>'a</literal> in the same use of
        <literal>first_if_true</literal>.

      Type errors vs exceptions
      </title>
      <para>
        There's a big difference in OCaml (and really in any compiled
        language) between errors that are caught at compile time and
        those that are caught at run-time. It's better to catch errors
        as early as possible in the development process, and compilation
        time is best of all.
      </para>
      <para>
        Working in the toplevel somewhat obscures the difference between
        run-time and compile time errors, but that difference is still
        there. Generally, type errors, like this one:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let add_potato x =
     x + &quot;potato&quot;;;
  Characters 28-36:

           ^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type
         int
</programlisting>
      <para>
        are compile-time errors (because <literal>+</literal> requires
        that both its arguments be of type <literal>int</literal>),
        whereas errors that can't be caught by the type system, like
        division by zero, lead to runtime exceptions.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let is_a_multiple x y =
     x mod y = 0 ;;
  val is_a_multiple : int -&gt; int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
# is_a_multiple 8 2;;
- : bool = true
# is_a_multiple 8 0;;
Exception: Division_by_zero.
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The distinction here is that type errors will stop you whether
        or not the offending code is ever actually executed. Merely
        defining <literal>add_potato</literal> is an error, whereas
        <literal>is_a_multiple</literal> only fails when it's called,
        and then, only when it's called with an input that triggers the
        exception.

      <title>Tuples</title>
      <para>
        So far we've encountered a handful of basic types like
        <literal>int</literal>, <literal>float</literal> and
        <literal>string</literal> as well as function types like
        <literal>string -&gt; int</literal>. But we haven't yet talked
        about any data structures. We'll start by looking at a
        particularly simple data structure, the tuple. A tuple is an
        ordered collection of values that can each be of different type.
        You can create a tuple by joining values together with a comma:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let a_tuple = (3,&quot;three&quot;);;
val a_tuple : int * string = (3, &quot;three&quot;)
</programlisting>
      <para>
        (For the mathematically inclined, the <literal>*</literal>
        character is used because the set of all pairs of type
        <literal>t * s</literal> corresponds to the Cartesian product of
        the set of elements of type <literal>t</literal> and the set of
        elements of type <literal>s</literal>.)
      </para>
      <para>
        You can extract the components of a tuple using OCaml's pattern
        matching syntax. For example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (x,y) = a_tuple;;
val x : int = 3
val y : string = &quot;three&quot;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Here, the <literal>(x,y)</literal> on the left-hand side of the
        <literal>let</literal> binding is the pattern. This pattern lets
        us mint the new variables <literal>x</literal> and
        <literal>y</literal>, each bound to different components of the
        value being matched, which can now be used in subsequent
        expressions.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# x + String.length y;;
- : int = 8
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Note that the same syntax is used both for constructing and for
        pattern matching on tuples.
      </para>
      <para>
        Pattern matching can also show up in function arguments. Here's
        a function for computing the distance between two points on the
        plane, where each point is represented as a pair of
        <literal>float</literal>s. The pattern matching syntax lets us
        get at the values we need with a minimum of fuss.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let distance (x1,y1) (x2,y2) =
    sqrt ((x1 -. x2) ** 2. +. (y1 -. y2) ** 2.)
  ;;
val distance : float * float -&gt; float * float -&gt; float = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The <literal>**</literal> operator used above is for raising a
        floating-point number to a power.
      </para>
      <para>
        This is just a first taste of pattern matching. Pattern matching
        is a pervasive tool in OCaml, and as you'll see, it has
        surprising power.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="lists">
      <title>Lists</title>
      <para>
        Where tuples let you combine a fixed number of items,
        potentially of different types, lists let you hold any number of
        items of the same type. For example:
      </para>

        Note that you can't mix elements of different types on the same
        list, as we did with tuples.

        <title>The <literal>List</literal> module</title>
        <para>
          Core comes with a <literal>List</literal> module that has a
          rich collection of functions for working with lists. We can
          access values from within a module by using dot-notation.
          Here, for example, is how we compute the length of a list.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.length languages;;
- : int = 3
</programlisting>
        <para>
          Here's something a little more complicated. We can compute the
          list of the lengths of each language as follows.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map languages ~f:String.length;;
- : int list = [5; 4; 1]
</programlisting>
        <para>
          <literal>List.map</literal> takes two arguments: a list and a
          function for transforming the elements of that list. Note that
          <literal>List.map</literal> creates a new list and does not
          modify the original.
        </para>
        <para>
          In this example, the function <literal>String.length</literal>
          is passed under the <emphasis>labeled argument</emphasis>
          <literal>~f</literal>. Labels allow you to specify function
          arguments by name rather than by position. As you can see
          below, we can change the order of labeled arguments without
          changing the function's behavior.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map ~f:String.length languages;;

        <title>Constructing lists with <literal>::</literal></title>
        <para>
          In addition to constructing lists using brackets, we can use
          the operator <literal>::</literal> for adding elements to the
          front of a list.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# &quot;French&quot; :: &quot;Spanish&quot; :: languages;;

</programlisting>
        <para>
          Here, we're creating a new and extended list, not changing the
          list we started with, as you can see below.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# languages;;
- : string list = [&quot;OCaml&quot;; &quot;Perl&quot;; &quot;C&quot;]
</programlisting>
        <para>
          The bracket notation for lists is really just syntactic sugar
          for <literal>::</literal>. Thus, the following declarations
          are all equivalent. Note that <literal>[]</literal> is used to
          represent the empty list.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# [1; 2; 3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: []));;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
</programlisting>
        <para>
          The <literal>::</literal> operator can only be used for adding
          one element to the front of the list, with the list
          terminating at <literal>[]</literal>, the empty list. There's
          also a list concatenation operator, <literal>@</literal>,
          which can concatenate two lists.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# [1;2;3] @ [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
</programlisting>
        <para>
          It's important to remember that, unlike <literal>::</literal>,
          this is not a constant-time operation. Concatenating two lists
          takes time proportional to the length of the first list.

        <title>List patterns using <literal>match</literal></title>
        <para>
          The elements of a list can be accessed through pattern
          matching. List patterns are based on the two list
          constructors, <literal>[]</literal> and <literal>::</literal>.
          Here's a simple example.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let my_favorite_language (my_favorite :: the_rest) =
     my_favorite
  ;;
</programlisting>
        <para>
          By pattern matching using <literal>::</literal>, we've
          isolated and named the first element of the list
          (<literal>my_favorite</literal>) and the remainder of the list
          (<literal>the_rest</literal>). If you know Lisp or Scheme,
          what we've done is the equivalent of using the functions
          <literal>car</literal> and <literal>cdr</literal> to isolate
          the first element of a list and the remainder of that list.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you try the above example in the toplevel, however, you'll
          see that it spits out a warning:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
    Characters 25-69:
  .........................(my_favorite :: the_rest) =
       my_favorite
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
[]
val my_favorite_language : 'a list -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
        <para>
          The warning comes because the compiler can't be certain that
          the pattern match won't lead to a runtime error. Indeed, the
          warning gives an example of a list, (<literal>[]</literal>,
          the empty list) that doesn't match the provided pattern.
          Indeed, if we try to run
          <literal>my_favorite_language</literal>, we'll see that it
          works on non-empty list, and fails on empty ones.
        </para>

        <para>
          You can avoid these warnings, and more importantly make sure
          that your code actually handles all of the possible cases, by
          using a <literal>match</literal> statement instead.
        </para>
        <para>
          A <literal>match</literal> statement is a kind of juiced-up
          version of the switch statement found in <literal>C</literal>
          and <literal>Java</literal>. It essentially lets you list a
          sequence of patterns (separated by <literal>|</literal>
          characters --- the one before the first case is optional), and
          the compiler then dispatches to the code following the first
          matched pattern. And, as we've already seen, we can name new
          variables in our patterns that correspond to sub-structures of
          the value being matched.

        <para>
          Here's a new version of

          <literal>match</literal> and doesn't trigger a compiler
          warning.

        <para>
          Note that we included a comment in the above code. OCaml
          comments are bounded by <literal>(*</literal> and
          <literal>*)</literal>, and can be nested arbitrarily and cover
          multiple lines. There's no equivalent of C-style single line
          comments that are prefixed by <literal>//</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          The first pattern, <literal>first :: the_rest</literal>,
          covers the case where <literal>languages</literal> has at
          least one element, since every list except for the empty list
          can be written down with one or more <literal>::</literal>'s.
          The second pattern, <literal>[]</literal>, matches only the
          empty list. These cases are exhaustive (every list is either
          empty, or has at least one element), and the compiler can
          detect that exhaustiveness, which is why it doesn't spit out a
          warning.

        <title>Recursive list functions</title>
        <para>
          Recursive functions, or, functions that call themselves, are
          an important technique in OCaml and in any functional
          language. The typical approach to designing a recursive
          function is to separate the logic into a set of <emphasis>base
          cases</emphasis>, that can be solved directly, and a set of
          <emphasis>inductive cases</emphasis>, where the function
          breaks the problem down into smaller pieces and then calls
          itself to solve those smaller problems.
        </para>
        <para>
          When writing recursive list functions, this separation between
          the base cases and the inductive cases is often done using
          pattern matching. Here's a simple example of a function that
          sums the elements of a list.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec sum l =
    match l with
    | [] -&gt; 0                   (* base case *)
    | hd :: tl -&gt; hd + sum tl   (* inductive case *)
  ;;
val sum : int list -&gt; int
# sum [1;2;3];;
- : int = 6
</programlisting>
        <para>
          Following the common OCaml idiom, we use <literal>hd</literal>
          to refer to the head of the list and <literal>tl</literal> to
          refer to the tail. Note that we had to use the
          <literal>rec</literal> keyword to allow <literal>sum</literal>
          to refer to itself. As you might imagine, the base case and
          inductive case are different arms of the match.
        </para>
        <para>
          Logically, you can think of the evaluation of a simple
          recursive function like <literal>sum</literal> almost as if it
          were a mathematical equation whose meaning you were unfolding
          step by step.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
sum [1;2;3]
1 + sum [2;3]
1 + (2 + sum [3])
1 + (2 + (3 + sum []))
1 + (2 + (3 + 0))
1 + (2 + 3)
1 + 5
6
</programlisting>
        <para>
          This suggests a reasonable mental model for what OCaml is
          actually doing to evaluate a recursive function.
        </para>
        <para>
          We can introduce more complicated list patterns as well.
          Here's a function for destuttering a list,
          <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, for removing sequential duplicates.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec destutter list =
    match list with
    | [] -&gt; []
    | hd1 :: hd2 :: tl -&gt;
      if hd1 = hd2 then destutter (hd2 :: tl)
      else hd1 :: destutter (hd2 :: tl)
  ;;
</programlisting>
        <para>
          Again, the first arm of the match is the base case, and the
          second is the inductive. Unfortunately, this code has a
          problem. If you type it into the toplevel, you'll see this
          error:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
_::[]
</programlisting>
        <para>
          This indicates that we're missing a case, in particular we
          don't handle one-element lists. Note how the underscore is
          used to indicate the presence of a value without specifying
          what that value is.
        </para>
        <para>
          We can fix this warning by adding another case to the match:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec destutter list =
    match list with
    | [] -&gt; []
    | hd :: [] -&gt; hd :: []
    | hd1 :: hd2 :: tl -&gt;
      if hd1 = hd2 then destutter (hd2 :: tl)
      else hd1 :: destutter (hd2 :: tl)
  ;;
val destutter : 'a list -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
# destutter [&quot;hey&quot;;&quot;hey&quot;;&quot;hey&quot;;&quot;man!&quot;];;
- : string list = [&quot;hey&quot;; &quot;man!&quot;]
</programlisting>
        <para>
          Note that this code used another variant of the list pattern,
          <literal>[hd]</literal>, to match a list with a single
          element. We can do this to match a list with any fixed number
          of elements, <emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>,
          <literal>[x;y;z]</literal> will match any list with exactly
          three elements, and will bind those elements to the variables
          <literal>x</literal>, <literal>y</literal> and
          <literal>z</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
          In the last few examples, our list processing code involved a
          lot of recursive functions. In practice, this isn't usually
          necessary. Most of the time, you'll find yourself happy to use
          the iteration functions found in the <literal>List</literal>
          module. But it's good to know how to use recursion when you
          need to do something new that's not already supported.

      </sect3>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="options">
      <title>Options</title>
      <para>
        Another common data structure in OCaml is the option. An option
        is used to express that a value might or might not be present.
        For example,
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let divide x y =
    if y = 0 then None else Some (x/y) ;;
val divide : int -&gt; int -&gt; int option = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The function <literal>divide</literal> either returns
        <literal>None</literal>, if the divisor is zero, or
        <literal>Some</literal> of the result of the division,
        otherwise. <literal>Some</literal> and <literal>None</literal>
        are constructors, like <literal>::</literal> and
        <literal>[]</literal> for lists, which let you build optional
        values. You can think of an option as a specialized list that
        can only have zero or one element.
      </para>
      <para>
        To examine the contents of an option, we use pattern matching,
        as we did with tuples and lists. Consider the following simple
        function for printing a log entry given an optional time and a
        message. If no time is provided (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, if
        the time is <literal>None</literal>), the current time is
        computed and used in its place.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let print_log_entry maybe_time message =
    let time =
      match maybe_time with
      | Some x -&gt; x
      | None -&gt; Time.now ()
    in
    printf &quot;%s: %s\n&quot; (Time.to_sec_string time) message ;;
val print_log_entry : Time.t option -&gt; string -&gt; unit
# print_log_entry (Some Time.epoch) &quot;A long long time ago&quot;;;
1969-12-31 19:00:00: A long long time ago

# print_log_entry None &quot;Up to the minute&quot;;;
2013-02-23 16:49:25: Up to the minute
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We use a <literal>match</literal> statement for handling the two
        possible states of an option.
      </para>
      <note> <title> 
      Nesting <literal>let</literal>s with <literal>let</literal> and
      <literal>in</literal>
      </title>
      <para>
        As a side note, this is our first use of <literal>let</literal>
        to define a new variable within the body of a function. A
        <literal>let</literal> bounded with an <literal>in</literal> can
        be used to introduce a new binding within any local scope,
        including a function body. The <literal>in</literal> marks the
        beginning of the scope within which the new variable can be
        used. Thus, we could write:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let x = 7 in
  x + x
  ;;
- : int = 14
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Note that the scope of the let binding is terminated by the
        double-semicolon.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can also have multiple let statements in a row, each one
        adding a new variable binding to what came before.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let x = 7 in
  let y = x * x in
  x + y
  ;;
- : int = 56
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This kind of nested let binding is a common way of building up a
        complex expression, with each <literal>let</literal> naming some
        component, before combining them in one final expression.
      </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        Options are important because they are the standard way in OCaml
        to encode a value that might not be there --- there's no such
        thing as a <literal>NullPointerException</literal> in OCaml.
        This is different from most other languages, including Java and
        C#, where most if not all datatypes are
        <emphasis>nullable</emphasis>, meaning that, whatever their type
        is, any given value also contains the possibility of being a
        null value. In such languages, null is lurking everywhere.
      </para>
      <para>
        In OCaml, however, nulls are explicit. A value of type
        <literal>string * string</literal> always actually contains two
        well-defined values of type <literal>string</literal>. If you
        want to allow, say, the first of those to be absent, then you
        need to change the type to
        <literal>string option * string</literal>. As we'll see in
        <xref linkend="error-handling"/>, this explicitness
        allows the compiler to provide a great deal of help in making
        sure you're correctly handing the possibility of missing data.
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="records-and-variants">
    <title>Records and Variants</title>
    <para>
      So far, we've looked only at data structures that were predefined
      in the language, like lists and tuples. But OCaml also allows us
      to define new datatypes. Here's a toy example of a datatype
      representing a point in 2-dimensional space:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type point2d = { x : float; y : float };;
type point2d = { x : float; y : float; }
</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>point2d</literal> is a <emphasis>record</emphasis> type,
      which you can think of as a tuple where the individual fields are
      named, rather than being defined positionally. Record types are
      easy enough to construct:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let p = { x = 3.; y = -4. };;
val p : point2d = {x = 3.; y = -4.}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      And we can get access to the contents of these types using pattern
      matching:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let magnitude { x = x_pos; y = y_pos } =
    sqrt (x_pos ** 2. +. y_pos ** 2.);;
val magnitude : point2d -&gt; float = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The pattern match here binds the variable <literal>x_pos</literal>
      to the value contained in the <literal>x</literal> field, and the
      variable <literal>y_pos</literal> to the value in the
      <literal>y</literal> field.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can write this more tersely using what's called <emphasis>field
      punning</emphasis>. When the name of the field and the name of the
      variable it is bound to in the match coincide, we don't have to
      write them both down. Using this, our magnitude function can be
      rewritten as follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let magnitude { x; y } = sqrt (x ** 2. +. y ** 2.);;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can also use dot-notation for accessing record fields:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let distance v1 v2 =
     magnitude { x = v1.x -. v2.x; y = v1.y -. v2.y };;
val distance : point2d -&gt; point2d -&gt; float = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      And we can of course include our newly defined types as components
      in larger types, as in the following types, each of which is a
      description of a different geometric object.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type circle_desc  = { center: point2d; radius: float }
  type rect_desc    = { lower_left: point2d; width: float; height: float }
  type segment_desc = { endpoint1: point2d; endpoint2: point2d } ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Now, imagine that you want to combine multiple objects of these
      types together as a description of a multi-object scene. You need
      some unified way of representing these objects together in a
      single type. One way of doing this is using a
      <emphasis>variant</emphasis> type:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type scene_element =
    | Circle  of circle_desc
    | Rect    of rect_desc
    | Segment of segment_desc
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>|</literal> character separates the different cases
      of the variant (the first <literal>|</literal> is optional), and
      each case has a tag, like <literal>Circle</literal>,
      <literal>Rect</literal> and <literal>Segment</literal>, to
      distinguish that case from the others. Here's how we might write a
      function for testing whether a point is in the interior of some
      element of a list of <literal>scene_element</literal>s.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let is_inside_scene_element point scene_element =
     match scene_element with
     | Circle { center; radius } -&gt;
       distance center point &lt; radius
     | Rect { lower_left; width; height } -&gt;
       point.x &gt; lower_left.x &amp;&amp; point.x &lt; lower_left.x +. width
       &amp;&amp; point.y &gt; lower_left.y &amp;&amp; point.y &lt; lower_left.y +. height
     | Segment { endpoint1; endpoint2 } -&gt; false
  ;;
val is_inside_scene_element : point2d -&gt; scene_element -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
# let is_inside_scene point scene =
     List.exists scene
       ~f:(fun el -&gt; is_inside_scene_element point el)
   ;;
val is_inside_scene : point2d -&gt; scene_element list -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
# is_inside_scene {x=3.;y=7.}
    [ Circle {center = {x=4.;y= 4.}; radius = 0.5 } ];;
- : bool = false
# is_inside_scene {x=3.;y=7.}
    [ Circle {center = {x=4.;y= 4.}; radius = 5.0 } ];;
- : bool = true
</programlisting>
    <para>
      You might at this point notice that the use of
      <literal>match</literal> here is reminiscent of how we used
      <literal>match</literal> with <literal>option</literal> and
      <literal>list</literal>. This is no accident:
      <literal>option</literal> and <literal>list</literal> are really
      just examples of variant types that happen to be important enough
      to be defined in the standard library (and in the case of lists,
      to have some special syntax).
    </para>
    <para>
      We also made our first use of an <emphasis>anonymous
      function</emphasis> in the call to <literal>List.exists</literal>.
      An anonymous function is a function that is defined but not named,
      in this case, using the <literal>fun</literal> keyword. Anonymous
      functions are common in OCaml, particularly when using iteration
      functions like <literal>List.exists</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The purpose of <literal>List.exists</literal> is to check if there
      are any elements of the given list in question on which the
      provided function evaluates to <literal>true</literal>. In this
      case, we're using <literal>List.exists</literal> to check if there
      is a scene element within which our point resides.

  <sect1 id="imperative-programming">
    <title>Imperative programming</title>
    <para>
      So far, we've only written so-called <emphasis>pure</emphasis> or
      <emphasis>functional</emphasis> code, meaning that we didn't write
      any code that modified a variable or value after its creation.
      Indeed, almost all of the data structures we've encountered so far
      are <emphasis>immutable</emphasis>, meaning there's no way in the
      language to modify them at all. This is a quite different style
      from <emphasis>imperative</emphasis> programming, where
      computations are structured as sequences of instructions that
      operate by modifying state as they go.
    </para>
    <para>
      Functional code is the default in OCaml, with variable bindings
      and most data structures being immutable. But OCaml also has
      excellent support for imperative programming, including mutable
      data structures like arrays and hashtables, and control-flow
      constructs like for and while loops.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="arrays">
      <title>Arrays</title>
      <para>
        Perhaps the simplest mutable data structure in OCaml is the
        array. Arrays in OCaml are very similar to arrays in other
        languages like C: indexing starts at 0, and accessing or
        modifying an array element is a constant-time operation. Arrays
        are more compact in terms of memory utilization than most other
        data structures in OCaml, including lists. Here's an example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let numbers = [| 1;2;3;4 |];;
val numbers : int array = [|1; 2; 3; 4|]
# numbers.(2) &lt;- 4;;
- : unit = ()
# numbers;;
- : int array = [|1; 2; 4; 4|]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        the <literal>.(i)</literal> syntax is used to refer to an
        element of an array, and the <literal>&lt;-</literal> syntax is
        for modification. Because the elements of the array are counted
        starting at zero, element <literal>.(2)</literal> is the third
        element.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="mutable-record-fields">
      <title>Mutable record fields</title>
      <para>
        The array is an important mutable data structure, but it's not
        the only one. Records, which are immutable by default, can be
        declared with specific fields as being mutable. Here's a small
        example of a data structure for storing a running statistical
        summary of a collection of numbers. Here's the basic data
        structure:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type running_sum =
   { mutable sum: float;
     mutable sum_sq: float; (* sum of squares *)
     mutable samples: int;
   }
  ;;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The fields in <literal>running_sum</literal> are designed to be
        easy to extend incrementally, and sufficient to compute means
        and standard deviations, as shown below. (Note that there are
        two let-bindings in a row without a double semicolon between
        them. That's because the double semicolon is required only to
        tell utop to process the input, not to separate two
        expressions.)
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let mean rsum = rsum.sum /. float rsum.samples

        <literal>rsum</literal> to reflect the addition of
        <literal>x</literal> to its set of samples, by updating the
        number of samples, the sum, and the sum of squares.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note the use in the above code of single semi-colons to sequence
        operations. When we were working purely functionally, this
        wasn't necessary, but you start needing it when your code is
        acting by side-effect.
      </para>
      <para>
        A new and somewhat odd type has cropped up in this example:
        <literal>unit</literal>. What makes <literal>unit</literal>
        different is that there is only one value of type
        <literal>unit</literal>, which is written <literal>()</literal>.
        Because there is only one value of type <literal>unit</literal>
        that value doesn't really convey any information.
      </para>
      <para>
        If it doesn't convey any information, then what is
        <literal>unit</literal> good for? Most of the time,
        <literal>unit</literal> acts as a placeholder. Thus, we use
        <literal>unit</literal> for the return value of a function like
        <literal>update</literal> that operates by side effect rather
        than by returning a value, and for the argument to a function
        like <literal>create</literal> that doesn't require any
        information to be passed into it in order to run. This is
        similar to the role that <literal>void</literal> plays in
        languages like C and Java.

      <para>
        The definition of all this is quite straightforward. Here is the
        complete implementation of the <literal>ref</literal> type. The
        <literal>'a</literal> before the ref indicates that the
        <literal>ref</literal> type is polymorphic, in the same way that
        lists are polymorphic, meaning it can contain values of any
        type.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

        Here, <literal>!</literal> and <literal>:=</literal> are infix

        marks them as such.
      </para>
      <para>
        Even though a <literal>ref</literal> is just another record
        type, it's notable because it is the standard way of simulating
        the traditional mutable variable you'll find in most imperative
        languages. For example, we can sum over the elements of a list
        imperatively by calling <literal>List.iter</literal> to call a
        simple function on every element of a list, using a ref to
        accumulate the results.

        This isn't the most idiomatic (or the fastest) way to sum up a

  <title>Variables and Functions</title>
  <para>
    Variables and functions are fundamental ideas that show up in
    virtually all programming languages. But OCaml has a different take
    on these basic concepts, and so we'll spend some time digging into
    the details so you can see how OCaml's variables and functions
    differ from what you may have encountered in other languages.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="variables">
    <title>Variables</title>
    <para>
      At its simplest, a variable is an identifier whose meaning is
      bound to a particular value. In OCaml these bindings are often
      introduced using the <literal>let</literal> keyword. We can type a
      so-called <emphasis>top-level</emphasis> <literal>let</literal>
      binding into <literal>utop</literal> with the following syntax to
      bind a new variable. Note that variable names must start with a
      lowercase letter.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let &lt;identifier&gt; = &lt;expr&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      As we'll see when we get to the module system in
      <xref linkend="files-modules-and-programs"/>, this same
      syntax is used for let bindings at the top-level of a module.
    </para>
    <para>
      Every variable binding has a <emphasis>scope</emphasis>, which is
      the portion of the code that can refer to that binding. The scope
      of a top-level let binding is everything that follows it in the
      session, when using <literal>utop</literal>, or, when using
      modules, for the remainder of the module.

      A let binding in an inner scope can <emphasis>shadow</emphasis>,
      or hide, the definition from an outer scope. So, for example, we
      could have written the <literal>dashed_languages</literal> example
      as follows:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let languages = &quot;OCaml,Perl,C++,C&quot;;;

    <para>
      This time, in the inner scope we called the list of strings
      <literal>languages</literal> instead of
      <literal>language_list</literal>, thus hiding the original
      definition of <literal>languages</literal>. But once the
      definition of <literal>dashed_languages</literal> is complete, the

      reappears.

      One common idiom is to use a series of nested
      <literal>let</literal>/<literal>in</literal> expressions to build
      up the components of a larger computation. Thus, we might write:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let area_of_ring inner_radius outer_radius =
     let pi = acos (-1.) in
     let area_of_circle r = pi *. r *. r in

</programlisting>
    <para>
      It's important not to confuse a sequence of let bindings with the
      modification of a mutable variable. For example, consider how
      <literal>area_of_ring</literal> would work if we had instead
      written this purposefully confusing bit of code.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let area_of_ring inner_radius outer_radius =
     let pi = acos (-1.) in
     let area_of_circle r = pi *. r *. r in
     let pi = 0. in
     area_of_circle outer_radius -. area_of_circle inner_radius
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Here, we redefined <literal>pi</literal> to be zero after the
      definition of <literal>area_of_circle</literal>. You might think
      that this would mean that the result of the computation would now
      be zero, but you'd be wrong. In fact, the behavior of the function
      is unchanged. That's because the original definition of
      <literal>pi</literal> wasn't changed, it was just shadowed, so
      that any subsequent reference to <literal>pi</literal> would see
      the new definition of <literal>pi</literal> as zero. But there is
      no later use of <literal>pi</literal>, so the binding doesn't make
      a difference. Indeed, if you type the example above into the
      toplevel, OCaml will warn you that the definition is unused.

      In OCaml, let bindings are immutable. As we'll see in

    Why don't variables vary?
    </title>
    <para>
      One source of confusion for people new to functional langauges is
      the fact that variables are typically immutable. This seems pretty
      surprising even on linguistic terms. Isn't the whole point of a
      variable that it can vary?
    </para>
    <para>
      The answer to this is that variables in a functional language are
      really more like variables in an equation. If you think about the
      mathematical equation <literal>x (y + z) = x y + x z</literal>,
      there's no notion of mutating the variables <literal>x</literal>,
      <literal>y</literal> and <literal>z</literal>. They vary in the
      sense that you can instantiate this equation with different
      numbers for those variables, and it still holds.
    </para>
    <para>
      The same is true in a functional language. A function can be
      applied to different inputs, and thus its variables will take on
      different values, even without mutation.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="pattern-matching-and-let">
      <title>Pattern matching and <literal>let</literal></title>
      <para>
        Another useful feature of let bindings is that they support the
        use of <emphasis>patterns</emphasis> on the left-hand side.
        Consider the following code, which uses
        <literal>List.unzip</literal>, a function for converting a list
        of pairs into a pair of lists.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (ints,strings) = List.unzip [(1,&quot;one&quot;); (2,&quot;two&quot;); (3,&quot;three&quot;)];;
val ints : int list = [1; 2; 3]
val strings : string list = [&quot;one&quot;; &quot;two&quot;; &quot;three&quot;]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Here, <literal>(ints,strings)</literal> is a pattern, and the
        <literal>let</literal> binding assigns values to both of the
        identifiers that show up in that pattern. A pattern is
        essentially a description of the shape of a data-structure,
        where some components are identifiers to be bound. As we saw in
        <xref linkend="tuples-lists-options-and-pattern-matching"/>,
        OCaml has patterns for a variety of different data-types.
      </para>
      <para>
        Using a pattern in a let-binding makes the most sense for a
        pattern that is <emphasis>irrefutable</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, where any value of the type in
        question is guaranteed to match the pattern. Tuple and record
        patterns are irrefutable, but list patterns are not. Consider
        the following code that implements a function for up-casing the
        first element of a comma-separated list.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let upcase_first_entry line =

        This case can't really come up in practice, because

    <title>Functions</title>
    <para>
      OCaml being a functional language, it's no surprise that functions
      are an important and pervasive element of programming in OCaml.
      Indeed, we've seen functions pop up already in many of the
      examples we've looked at thus far. But while we've introduced the
      basics of functions, we're now going to cover them in more depth,
      starting from the foundations.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="anonymous-functions">
      <title>Anonymous Functions</title>
      <para>
        We'll start by looking at the most basic style of function
        declaration in OCaml: the <emphasis>anonymous</emphasis>
        function. An anonymous function is a function value that is
        declared without being named. They can be declared using the
        <literal>fun</literal> keyword, as shown here.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# (fun x -&gt; x + 1);;
- : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Anonymous functions aren't named, but they can be used for many
        different purposes nonetheless. You can, for example, apply an
        anonymous function to an argument.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# (fun x -&gt; x + 1) 7;;
- : int = 8
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Or pass it to another function. Passing functions to iteration
        functions like <literal>List.map</literal> is probably the most
        common use-case for anonymous functions.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map ~f:(fun x -&gt; x + 1) [1;2;3];;
- : int list = [2; 3; 4]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Or even stuff them into a data structure.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let increments = [ (fun x -&gt; x + 1); (fun x -&gt; x + 2) ] ;;
val increments : (int -&gt; int) list = [&lt;fun&gt;; &lt;fun&gt;]
# List.map ~f:(fun f -&gt; f 5) increments;;
- : int list = [6; 7]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        It's worth stopping for a moment to puzzle this example out,
        since this kind of higher-order use of functions can be a bit
        obscure at first. The first thing to understand is the function
        <literal>(fun f -&gt; f 5)</literal>, which takes a function as
        its argument and applies that function to the number
        <literal>5</literal>. The invocation of
        <literal>List.map</literal> applies
        <literal>(fun f -&gt; f 5)</literal> to the elements of the
        <literal>increments</literal> list (which are themselves
        functions) and returns the list containing the results of these
        function applications.
      </para>
      <para>
        The key thing to understand is that functions are ordinary
        values in OCaml, and you can do everything with them that you'd
        do with an ordinary value, including passing them to and
        returning them from other functions and storing them in data
        structures. We even name functions in the same way that we name
        other values, by using a let binding.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let plusone = (fun x -&gt; x + 1);;
val plusone : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# plusone 3;;
- : int = 4
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Defining named functions is so common that there is a built in
        syntax for it. Thus, the following definition of
        <literal>plusone</literal> is equivalent to the definition
        above.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

      <para>
        This is the most common and convenient way to declare a
        function, but syntactic niceties aside, the two styles of
        function definition are entirely equivalent.

      <literal>let</literal> and <literal>fun</literal>
      </title>
      <para>
        Functions and let bindings have a lot to do with each other. In
        some sense, you can think of the argument of a function as a
        variable being bound to the value passed by the caller. Indeed,
        the following two expressions are nearly equivalent:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# (fun x -&gt; x + 1) 7;;
- : int = 8
# let x = 7 in x + 1;;
- : int = 8

        This connection is important, and will come up more when

    <sect2 id="multi-argument-functions">
      <title>Multi-argument functions</title>
      <para>
        OCaml of course also supports multi-argument functions, for
        example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let abs_diff x y = abs (x - y);;
val abs_diff : int -&gt; int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# abs_diff 3 4;;
- : int = 1
</programlisting>
      <para>
        You may find the type signature of <literal>abs_diff</literal>
        with all of its arrows a little hard to parse. To understand
        what's going on, let's rewrite <literal>abs_diff</literal> in an
        equivalent form, using the <literal>fun</literal> keyword:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let abs_diff =
    (fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; abs (x - y)));;
val abs_diff : int -&gt; int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This rewrite makes it explicit that <literal>abs_diff</literal>
        is actually a function of one argument that returns another
        function of one argument, which itself returns the final
        computation. Because the functions are nested, the inner
        expression <literal>abs (x - y)</literal> has access to both
        <literal>x</literal>, which was captured by the first function
        application, and <literal>y</literal>, which was captured by the
        second one.
      </para>
      <para>
        This style of function is called a <emphasis>curried</emphasis>
        function. (Currying is named after Haskell Curry, a famous
        logician who had a significant impact on the design and theory
        of programming languages.) The key to interpreting the type
        signature of a curried function is the observation that
        <literal>-&gt;</literal> is right-associative. The type
        signature of <literal>abs_diff</literal> can therefore be
        parenthesized as follows. This doesn't change the meaning of the
        signature, but it makes it easier to see how the currying fits
        in.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
val abs_diff : int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Currying is more than just a theoretical curiosity. You can make
        use of currying to specialize a function by feeding in some of
        the arguments. Here's an example where we create a specialized
        version of <literal>abs_diff</literal> that measures the
        distance of a given number from <literal>3</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let dist_from_3 = abs_diff 3;;
val dist_from_3 : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# dist_from_3 8;;
- : int = 5
# dist_from_3 (-1);;
- : int = 4
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The practice of applying some of the arguments of a curried
        function to get a new function is called <emphasis>partial
        application</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that the <literal>fun</literal> keyword supports its own
        syntax for currying, so the following definition of
        <literal>abs_diff</literal> is equivalent to the definition
        above.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let abs_diff = (fun x y -&gt; abs (x - y));;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        You might worry that curried functions are terribly expensive,
        but this is not the case. In OCaml, there is no penalty for
        calling a curried function with all of its arguments. (Partial
        application, unsurprisingly, does have a small extra cost.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Currying is not the only way of writing a multi-argument
        function in OCaml. It's also possible to use the different arms
        of a tuple as different arguments. So, we could write:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let abs_diff (x,y) = abs (x - y)
val abs_diff : int * int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# abs_diff (3,4);;
- : int = 1
</programlisting>
      <para>
        OCaml handles this calling convention efficiently as well. In
        particular it does not generally have to allocate a tuple just
        for the purpose of sending arguments to a tuple-style function.
        (You can't, however, use partial application for this style of
        function.)
      </para>
      <para>
        There are small tradeoffs between these two approaches, but most
        of the time, one should stick to currying, since it's the
        default style in the OCaml world.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="recursive-functions">
      <title>Recursive functions</title>
      <para>
        A function is <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> if it refers to
        itself in its definition. Recursion is important in any
        programming language, but is particularly important in
        functional languages, because it is the fundamental building
        block that is used for building looping constructs. (As we'll
        see in <xref linkend="imperative-programming"/>, OCaml
        also supports imperative looping constructs like
        <literal>for</literal> and <literal>while</literal>, but these
        are only useful when using OCaml's imperative features.)
      </para>
      <para>
        In order to define a recursive function, you need to mark the
        let binding as recursive with the <literal>rec</literal>
        keyword, as shown in this example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec find_first_stutter list =
    match list with
    | [] | [_] -&gt;
      (* only zero or one elements, so no repeats *)
      None
    | x :: y :: tl -&gt;
      if x = y then Some x else find_first_stutter (y::tl)
   ;;
val find_first_stutter : 'a list -&gt; 'a option = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Note that in the above, the pattern
        <literal>| [] | [_]</literal> is actually the combination of two
        patterns; <literal>[]</literal>, matching the empty list, and
        <literal>[_]</literal>, matching any single element list. The
        <literal>_</literal> is there so we don't have to put an
        explicit name on that single element.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can also define multiple mutually recursive values by using
        <literal>let rec</literal> combined with the
        <literal>and</literal> keyword. Here's a (gratuitously
        inefficient) example.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec is_even x =
    if x = 0 then true else is_odd (x - 1)
  and is_odd x =
    if x = 0 then false else is_even (x - 1)
 ;;
val is_even : int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
val is_odd : int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
# List.map ~f:is_even [0;1;2;3;4;5];;

- : bool list = [false; true; false; true; false; true]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        OCaml distinguishes between non-recursive definitions (using
        <literal>let</literal>) and recursive definitions (using
        <literal>let rec</literal>) largely for technical reasons: the
        type-inference algorithm needs to know when a set of function
        definitions are mutually recursive, and for reasons that don't
        apply to a pure language like Haskell, these have to be marked
        explicitly by the programmer.
      </para>
      <para>
        But this decision has some good effects. For one thing,
        recursive (and especially mutually recursive) definitions are
        harder to reason about than non-recursive definitions that
        proceed in order, each building on top of what has already been
        defined. It's therefore useful that, in the absence of an
        explicit marker, new definitions can only build upon ones that
        were previously defined.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition, having a non-recursive form makes it easier to
        create a new definition that extends and supersedes an existing
        one by shadowing it.

      <title>Prefix and Infix operators</title>
      <para>
        So far, we've seen examples of functions used in both prefix and
        infix style:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Int.max 3 4;;  (* prefix *)
- : int = 4
# 3 + 4;;        (* infix  *)
- : int = 7
</programlisting>
      <para>
        You might not have thought of the second example as an ordinary
        function, but it very much is. Infix operators like
        <literal>+</literal> really only differ syntactically from other
        functions. In fact, if we put parenthesis around an infix
        operator, you can use it as an ordinary prefix function.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# (+) 3 4;;
- : int = 7
# List.map ~f:((+) 3) [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [7; 8; 9]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In the second expression above, we've partially applied
        <literal>(+)</literal> to gain a function that increments its
        single argument by <literal>3</literal>, and then applied that
        to all the elements of a list.
      </para>
      <para>
        A function is treated syntactically as an operator if the name
        of that function is chosen from one of a specialized set of
        identifiers. This set includes any identifier that is a sequence
        of characters from the following set
      </para>
      <programlisting>
! $ % &amp; * + - . / : &lt; = &gt; ? @ ^ | ~
</programlisting>
      <para>
        or is one of a handful of pre-determined strings, including
        <literal>mod</literal>, the modulus operator, and
        <literal>lsl</literal>, for &quot;logical shift left&quot;, a
        bit-shifting operation.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can define (or redefine) the meaning of an operator as
        follows. Here's an example of a simple vector-addition operator
        on int pairs.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (+!) (x1,y1) (x2,y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2);;
val ( +! ) : int * int -&gt; int * int -&gt; int * int = &lt;fun&gt;
# (3,2) +! (-2,4);;
- : int * int = (1,6)
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The syntactic role of an operator is typically determined by its
        first character or two, though there are a few exceptions. This
        table breaks the different operators and other syntactic forms
        into groups from highest to lowest precedence, explaining how
        each behaves syntactically. We write <literal>!</literal>... to
        indicate the class of operators beginning with
        <literal>!</literal>.

      <para>
        There's one important special case: <literal>-</literal> and
        <literal>-.</literal>, which are the integer and floating point
        subtraction operators, can act as both prefix operators (for
        negation) and infix operators (for subtraction), So, both
        <literal>-x</literal> and <literal>x - y</literal> are
        meaningful expressions.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here's an example of a very useful operator that's defined in
        Core, following these rules. Here's the definition:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (|&gt;) x f = f x ;;
val ( |&gt; ) : 'a -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        It's not quite obvious at first what the purpose of this
        operator is: it just takes some value and a function, and
        applies the function to the value. But its utility is clearer
        when you see it in action. It works as a kind of sequencing
        operator, similar in spirit to using pipe in the UNIX shell.
        Consider, for example, the following code for printing out the
        unique elements of your <literal>PATH</literal>. Note that
        <literal>List.dedup</literal> below removes duplicates from a
        list by sorting the list using the provided comparison function.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Sys.getenv_exn &quot;PATH&quot;
  |&gt; String.split ~on:':'
  |&gt; List.dedup ~compare:String.compare
  |&gt; List.iter ~f:print_endline
  ;;
/bin
/opt/local/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Note that we can do this without <literal>|&gt;</literal>, but
        the result is a bit more verbose.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let path = Sys.getenv_exn &quot;PATH&quot; in
  let split_path = String.split ~on:':' path in
  let deduped_path = List.dedup ~compare:String.compare split_path in
  List.iter ~f:print_endline deduped_path
  ;;
/bin
/opt/local/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
      <para>
        An important part of what's happening here is partial
        application. Normally, <literal>List.iter</literal> takes two
        arguments: a function to be called on each element of the list,
        and the list to iterate over. We can call
        <literal>List.iter</literal> with all its arguments:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.iter ~f:print_endline [&quot;Two&quot;; &quot;lines&quot;];;
Two
lines
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Or, we can pass it just the function argument, leaving us with a
        function for printing out a list of strings.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.iter ~f:print_endline;;
- : string list -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        It is this later form that we're using in the
        <literal>|&gt;</literal> pipeline above.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that <literal>|&gt;</literal> only works in the intended
        way because it is left-associative. Indeed, let's see what
        happens if we try using a right associative operator, like (^!).
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (^!) = (|&gt;);;
val ( ^! ) : 'a -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b = &lt;fun&gt;
# Sys.getenv_exn &quot;PATH&quot;
  ^! String.split ~on:':'
  ^! List.dedup ~compare:String.compare
  ^! List.iter ~f:print_endline
  ;;
        Characters 93-119:
    ^! List.iter ~f:print_endline
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type string list -&gt; unit
       but an expression was expected of type
         (string list -&gt; string list) -&gt; 'a
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The above type error is a little bewildering at first glance.
        What's going on is that, because <literal>^!</literal> is right
        associative, the operator is trying to feed the value
        <literal>List.dedup ~compare:String.compare</literal> to the
        function <literal>List.iter ~f:print_endline</literal>. But
        <literal>List.iter ~f:print_endline</literal> expects a list of
        strings as its input, not a function.
      </para>
      <para>
        The type error aside, this example highlights the importance of
        choosing the operator you use with care, particularly with
        respect to associativity.
      </para>

    <sect2 id="declaring-functions-with-function">
      <title>Declaring functions with
      <literal>function</literal></title>
      <para>
        Another way to define a function is using the
        <literal>function</literal> keyword. Instead of having syntactic
        support for declaring multi-argument (curried) functions,
        <literal>function</literal> has built-in pattern matching.
        Here's an example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let some_or_zero = function
     | Some x -&gt; x
     | None -&gt; 0
  ;;
val some_or_zero : int option -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# List.map ~f:some_or_zero [Some 3; None; Some 4];;
- : int list = [3; 0; 4]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This is equivalent to combining an ordinary function definition
        with a <literal>match</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let some_or_zero num_opt =
    match num_opt with
    | Some x -&gt; x
    | None -&gt; 0
  ;;
val some_or_zero : int option -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We can also combine the different styles of function declaration
        together, as in the following example where we declare a two
        argument (curried) function with a pattern match on the second
        argument.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let some_or_default default = function
     | Some x -&gt; x
     | None -&gt; default
  ;;
# some_or_default 3 (Some 5);;
- : int = 5
# List.map ~f:(some_or_default 100) [Some 3; None; Some 4];;
- : int list = [3; 100; 4]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Also, note the use of partial application to generate the
        function passed to <literal>List.map</literal>. In other words,
        <literal>some_or_default 100</literal> is a function that was
        created by feeding just the first argument to
        <literal>some_or_default</literal>.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="labeled-arguments">
      <title>Labeled Arguments</title>
      <para>
        Up until now, we've written functions where the arguments are
        specified positionally, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, by the order
        in which the arguments are passed to the function. OCaml also
        supports labeled arguments, which let you identify a function
        argument by name. Labels are marked by a leading tilde, and a
        label (followed by a colon) are put in front of the variable to
        be labeled.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let ratio ~num ~denom = float num /. float denom;;
val ratio : num:int -&gt; denom:int -&gt; float = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We can then provide a labeled argument using a similar
        convention. As you can see, the arguments can be provided in any
        order.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# ratio ~num:3 ~denom:10;;
- : float = 0.3
# ratio ~denom:10 ~num:3;;
- : float = 0.3
</programlisting>
      <para>
        OCaml also supports <emphasis>label punning</emphasis>, meaning
        that you get to drop the text after the <literal>:</literal> if
        the name of the label and the name of the variable being used
        are the same. We've seen above how label punning works when
        defining a function. The following shows how it can be used when
        invoking a function.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let num = 3;;
# let denom = 4;;
# ratio ~num ~denom;;
- : float = 0.75
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Labeled arguments are useful in a few different cases:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            When defining a function with lots of arguments. Beyond a
            certain number, arguments are easier to remember by name
            than by position.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            When defining functions that have multiple arguments that
            might get confused with each other. This is most at issue
            when the arguments are of the same type. For example,
            consider this signature for a function for extracting a
            substring of another string.
          </para>
          <programlisting language="ocaml">
val substring: string -&gt; int -&gt; int -&gt; string
</programlisting>
          <para>
            where the two ints are the starting position and length of
            the substring to extract. Labeled arguments can make this
            signature clearer:
          </para>
          <programlisting language="ocaml">
val substring: string -&gt; pos:int -&gt; len:int -&gt; string
</programlisting>
          <para>
            This improves the readability of both the signature and of
            client code that makes use of <literal>substring</literal>,
            and makes it harder to accidentally swap the position and
            the length.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            When the meaning of a particular argument is unclear from
            the type alone. For example, consider a function for
            creating a hashtable where the first argument is the initial
            size of the table, and the second argument is a flag which,
            when true, indicates that the hashtable will reduce its size
            when the hashtable contains few elements. The following
            signature doesn't give you much of a hint as to the meaning
            of the arguments.
          </para>
          <programlisting language="ocaml">
val create_hashtable : int -&gt; bool -&gt; ('a,'b) Hashtable.t
</programlisting>

            When you want flexibility on the order in which arguments
            are passed. Consider a function like
            <literal>List.iter</literal>, that takes two arguments: a
            function, and a list of elements to call that function on. A
            common pattern is to partially apply
            <literal>List.iter</literal> by giving it just the function,
            as in the following example from earlier in the chapter.
            This requires putting the function argument first.

            In other cases, you want to put the function argument

            multi-line function passed as an argument to another
            function is easiest to read when it is the final argument to
            that function.

          One surprising gotcha with labeled arguments is that while

      <title>Optional arguments</title>
      <para>
        An optional argument is like a labeled argument that the caller
        can choose whether or not to provide. Optional arguments are
        passed in using the same syntax as labeled arguments, and, like
        labeled arguments, optional arguments can be provided in any
        order.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here's an example of a string concatenation function with an
        optional separator. This function uses the <literal>^</literal>
        operator for simple pairwise string concatenation.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let concat ?sep x y =
     let sep = match sep with None -&gt; &quot;&quot; | Some x -&gt; x in

  ;;
val concat : ?sep:string -&gt; string -&gt; string -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
# concat &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;;;             (* without the optional argument *)

# concat ~sep:&quot;:&quot; &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;;;    (* with the optional argument    *)
- : string = &quot;foo:bar&quot;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Here, <literal>?</literal> is used in the definition of the
        function to mark <literal>sep</literal> as optional. And while
        the caller can pass a value of type <literal>string</literal>
        for <literal>sep</literal>, internally to the function,
        <literal>sep</literal> is seen as a
        <literal>string option</literal>, with <literal>None</literal>
        appearing when <literal>sep</literal> is not provided by the
        caller.
      </para>
      <para>
        In the above example, we had a bit of code to substitute in the
        empty string when no argument was provided. This is a common
        enough pattern that there's an explicit syntax for providing a
        default value, which allows us to write
        <literal>concat</literal> even more concisely.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let concat ?(sep=&quot;&quot;) x y = x ^ sep ^ y ;;

</programlisting>
      <para>
        Optional arguments are very useful, but they're also easy to
        abuse. The key advantage of optional arguments is that they let
        you write functions with multiple arguments that users can
        ignore most of the time, only worrying about them when they
        specifically want to invoke those options.
      </para>
      <para>
        The downside is that the caller may be unaware that there is a
        choice to be made, and so may unknowingly (and wrongly) pick
        that default behavior. Optional arguments really only make sense
        when the extra concision of omitting the argument overwhelms the
        corresponding loss of explicitness.
      </para>
      <para>
        This means that rarely used functions should not have optional
        arguments. A good rule of thumb is to avoid optional arguments
        for functions internal to a module, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>,
        functions that are not included in the module's interface, or
        <literal>mli</literal> file. We'll learn more about
        <literal>mli</literal>s in

      <sect3 id="explicit-passing-of-an-optional-argument">
        <title>Explicit passing of an optional argument</title>
        <para>
          Under the covers, a function with an optional argument
          receives <literal>None</literal> when the caller doesn't
          provide the argument, and <literal>Some</literal> when it
          does. But the <literal>Some</literal> and
          <literal>None</literal> are normally not explicitly passed in
          by the caller.
        </para>
        <para>
          But sometimes, passing in <literal>Some</literal> or
          <literal>None</literal> explicitly is exactly what you want.
          OCaml lets you do this by using <literal>?</literal> instead
          of <literal>~</literal> to mark the argument. Thus, the
          following two lines are equivalent ways of specifying the
          <literal>sep</literal> argument to concat.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">

        <para>
          And the following two lines are equivalent ways of calling

- : string = &quot;foobar&quot;
</programlisting>
        <para>
          One use-case for this is when you want to define a wrapper
          function that mimics the optional arguments of the function
          it's wrapping. For example, imagine we wanted to create a
          function called <literal>uppercase_concat</literal>, which is
          the same as <literal>concat</literal> except that it converts
          the first string that it's passed to uppercase. We could write
          the function as follows.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let uppercase_concat ?(sep=&quot;&quot;) a b = concat ~sep (String.uppercase a) b ;;
val uppercase_concat : ?sep:string -&gt; string -&gt; string -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
# uppercase_concat &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;;;

- : string = &quot;FOO:bar&quot;
</programlisting>
        <para>
          In the way we've written it, we've been forced to separately
          make the decision as to what the default separator is. Thus,
          if we later change <literal>concat</literal>'s default
          behavior, we'll need to remember to change
          <literal>uppercase_concat</literal> to match it.
        </para>
        <para>
          Instead, we can have <literal>uppercase_concat</literal>
          simply pass through the optional argument to
          <literal>concat</literal> using the <literal>?</literal>
          syntax.

        <para>
          Now, if someone calls <literal>uppercase_concat</literal>
          without an argument, an explicit <literal>None</literal> will
          be passed to <literal>concat</literal>, leaving
          <literal>concat</literal> to decide what the default behavior

        <title>Inference of labeled and optional arguments</title>
        <para>
          One subtle aspect of labeled and optional arguments is how
          they are inferred by the type system. Consider the following
          example for computing numerical derivatives of a function of
          two dimensions. The function takes an argument
          <literal>delta</literal> which determines the scale at which
          to compute the derivative, values <literal>x</literal> and
          <literal>y</literal> which determine which point to compute
          the derivative at, and the function <literal>f</literal> whose
          derivative is being computed. The function
          <literal>f</literal> itself takes two labeled arguments
          <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal>. Note that you
          can use an apostrophe as part of a variable name, so
          <literal>x'</literal> and <literal>y'</literal> are just
          ordinary variables.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">

        <para>
          In principle, it's not obvious how the order of the arguments
          to <literal>f</literal> should be chosen. Since labeled
          arguments can be passed in arbitrary order, it seems like it
          could as well be
          <literal>y:float -&gt; x:float -&gt; float</literal> as it is
          <literal>x:float -&gt; y:float -&gt; float</literal>.

          Even worse, it would be perfectly consistent for
          <literal>f</literal> to take an optional argument instead of a

          Since there are multiple plausible types to choose from, OCaml
          needs some heuristic for choosing between them. The heuristic

          The rule is: an optional argument is erased as soon as the

          optional argument is passed in. That explains the behavior of
          <literal>prepend_pound</literal> above. But if we had instead
          defined <literal>concat</literal> with the optional argument
          in the second position:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">

          then application of the first argument would not cause the

        <para>
          However, if all arguments to a function are presented at once,
          then erasure of optional arguments isn't applied until all of
          the arguments are passed in. This preserves our ability to
          pass in optional arguments anywhere on the argument list.

        <para>
          An optional argument that doesn't have any following

  <title>Lists and Patterns</title>
  <para>
    This chapter will focus on two common elements of programming in
    OCaml: lists and pattern matching. Both of these were discussed in
    <xref linkend="a-guided-tour"/>, but we'll go into more
    depth here, presenting the two topics together and using one to help
    illustrate the other.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="list-basics">
    <title>List Basics</title>
    <para>
      An OCaml list is an immutable, finite sequence of elements of the
      same type. As we've seen, OCaml lists can be generated using a
      bracket-and-semicolon notation:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# [1;2;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      And they can also be generated using the equivalent
      <literal>::</literal> notation.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: [])) ;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [] ;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      As you can see, the <literal>::</literal> operator is
      right-associative, which means that we can built up lists without
      parenthesis. The empty list <literal>[]</literal> is used to
      terminate a list.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>::</literal> operator conveys something important
      about the nature of lists, which is that they are implemented as
      singly-linked lists. The following is a rough graphical
      representation of how the list
      <literal>1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []</literal> is laid out as a
      data-structure. The final arrow (from the box containing
      <literal>3</literal>) points to the empty list.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
| 1 | *----&gt;| 2 | *----&gt;| 3 | *----&gt;||
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>::</literal> operator essentially adds a new block to
      the picture above. Such a block contains two things: a reference
      to the data in that list element, and a reference to the remainder
      of the list. This is why <literal>::</literal> can extend a list
      without modifying it; extension allocates a new list element but
      doesn't need to change any of the existing ones, as you can see:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let l = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
val l : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# let m = 0 :: l;;
val m : int list = [0; 1; 2; 3]
# l;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
</programlisting>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="using-patterns-to-extract-data-from-a-list">
    <title>Using patterns to extract data from a list</title>
    <para>
      We can read data out of a list using a match statement. Here's a
      simple example of a recursive function that computes the sum of
      all elements of a list.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec sum l =
    match l with
    | [] -&gt; 0
    | hd :: tl -&gt; hd + sum tl
  ;;
val sum : int list -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# sum [1;2;3];;
- : int = 6
# sum [];;
- : int = 0
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This code follows the convention of using <literal>hd</literal> to
      represent the first element (or head) of the list, and
      <literal>tl</literal> to represent the remainder (or tail).
    </para>
    <para>
      The match statement in <literal>sum</literal> is really doing two
      things: first, it's acting as a case-analysis tool, breaking down
      the possibilities into a pattern-indexed list of cases. Second, it
      lets you name sub-structures within the data-structure being
      matched. In this case, the variables <literal>hd</literal> and
      <literal>tl</literal> are bound by the pattern that defines the
      first case of the match statment. Variables that are bound in this
      way can be used in the expression to the right of the arrow for
      the pattern in question.
    </para>
    <para>
      The fact that match statements can be used to bind new variables
      can be a source of confusion. To see how, imagine we wanted to
      write a function that filtered out from a list all elements equal
      to a particular value. You might be tempted to write that code as
      follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec drop_value l to_drop =
    match l with
    | [] -&gt; []
    | to_drop :: tl -&gt; drop_value tl to_drop
    | hd :: tl -&gt; hd :: drop_value tl to_drop
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      But when we type this in, the compiler will immediately warn us
      that something is wrong. Moreover, the function clearly does the
      wrong thing, filtering out all elements of the list rather than
      just those equal to the provided value.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
Characters 114-122:
      | hd :: tl -&gt; hd :: drop_value tl to_drop
        ^^^^^^^^
Warning 11: this match case is unused.
val drop_value : 'a list -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
# drop_value [1;2;3] 2;;
- : int list = []
</programlisting>
    <para>
      So, what's going on?
    </para>
    <para>
      The key observation is that the appearance of
      <literal>to_drop</literal> in the second case doesn't imply a
      check that the first element is equal to the value
      <literal>to_drop</literal> passed in as an argument to
      <literal>drop_value</literal>. Instead, it just causes a new
      variable <literal>to_drop</literal> to be bound to whatever
      happens to be in the first element of the list, shadowing the
      earlier definition of <literal>to_drop</literal>. The third case
      is unused because it is essentially the same pattern as we had in
      the second case.
    </para>
    <para>
      A better way to write this code is not to use pattern matching for
      determining whether the first element is equal to
      <literal>to_drop</literal>, but to instead use an ordinary
      if-statement.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec drop_value l to_drop =
    match l with
    | [] -&gt; []
    | hd :: tl -&gt;

</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that if we wanted to drop a particular literal value (rather
      than a value that was passed in), we could do this using something
      like our original implementation of <literal>drop_value</literal>.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="limitations-and-blessings-of-pattern-matching">
    <title>Limitations (and blessings) of pattern matching</title>
    <para>
      The above example highlights an important fact about patterns,
      which is that they can't be used to express arbitrary conditions.
      Patterns can characterize the layout of a data-structure, and can
      even include literals as in the <literal>drop_zero</literal>
      example, but that's where they stop. A pattern can check if a list
      has two elements, but it can't check if the first two elements are
      equal to each other.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can think of patterns as a specialized sub-language that can
      express a limited (though still quite rich) set of conditions. The
      fact that the pattern language is limited turns out to be a very
      good thing, making it possible to build better support for
      patterns in the compiler. In particular, both the efficiency of
      match statements and the ability of the compiler to detect errors
      in matches depend on the constrained nature of patterns.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="performance">
      <title>Performance</title>
      <para>
        Naively, you might think that it would be necessary to check
        each case in a <literal>match</literal> in sequence to figure
        out which one fires. If the cases of a match were guarded by
        arbitrary code, that would be the case. But OCaml is often able
        to generate machine code that jumps directly to the matched case
        based on an efficiently chosen set of run-time checks.
      </para>
      <para>
        As an example, consider the following rather silly functions for
        incrementing an integer by one. The first is implemented with a
        match statement, and the second with a sequence of if
        statements.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
let plus_one x =
  match x with
  | 0 -&gt; 1
  | 1 -&gt; 2
  | 2 -&gt; 3
  | _ -&gt; x + 1

let plus_one_slow x =
  if      x = 0 then 1
  else if x = 1 then 2
  else if x = 2 then 3
  else x + 1
</programlisting>
      <para>
        If you benchmark these, you'll see that
        <literal>plus_one_slow</literal> is about 35% slower than
        <literal>plus_one</literal>, and the advantage gets larger as
        the number of cases increases.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here's another less artificial example. We can rewrite the
        <literal>sum</literal> function we described earlier in the
        chapter using an <literal>if</literal> statement rather than a
        match. We can then use the functions
        <literal>is_empty</literal>, <literal>hd_exn</literal> and
        <literal>tl_exn</literal> from the <literal>List</literal>
        module to deconstruct the list, allowing us to implement the
        entire function without pattern matching.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
let rec sum_slow l =
  if List.is_empty l then 0
  else List.hd_exn l + sum_slow (List.tl_exn l)
;;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In this case, the match-based implementation is 70% faster than
        the one using if. The difference comes because we need to
        effectively do the same work multiple times, since each function
        we call has to re-examine the first element of the list to
        determine whether or not it's the empty cell. With a match
        statement, this work happens exactly once per list element.
      </para>
      <para>
        Generally, pattern matching is typically more efficient than the
        alternatives you might code by hand. One notable exception is
        matches over strings, which are in fact tested sequentially. But
        most of the time, using pattern matching is a clear performance
        win.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="detecting-errors">
      <title>Detecting errors</title>
      <para>
        The error-detecting capabilities of match statements are if
        anything more important than their performance. We've already
        seen one example of OCaml's ability to find problems in a
        pattern match: in our broken implementation of
        <literal>drop_value</literal>, OCaml warned us that the final
        case was redundant. There are no algorithms for determining if a
        predicate written in a general-purpose language is redundant,
        but it can be solved reliably in the context of patterns.
      </para>
      <para>
        OCaml also checks match statements for exhaustiveness. Consider
        what happens if we modify <literal>drop_zero</literal> by
        deleting the handler for one of the cases.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec drop_zero l =
    match l with
    | [] -&gt; []
    | 0  :: tl -&gt; drop_zero tl
  ;;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The compiler will produce a warning that we've missed a case,
        along with an example of an unmatched pattern.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
val drop_zero : int list -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
Characters 26-84:
Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
1::_
</programlisting>
      <para>
        For simple examples like this, exhaustiveness checks are useful
        enough. But as we'll see in
        <xref linkend="variants"/>, as you get to more
        complicated examples, especially those involving user-defined
        types, exhaustiveness checks become a lot more valuable. In
        addition to catching outright errors, they act as a sort of
        refactoring tool, guiding you to the locations where you need to
        adapt your code to deal with changing types.
      </para>

  <sect1 id="using-the-list-module-effectively">
    <title>Using the <literal>List</literal> module effectively</title>
    <para>
      We've so far written a fair amount of list-munging code using
      pattern matching and recursive functions. But in real life, you're
      usually better off using the <literal>List</literal> module, which
      is full of reusable functions that abstract out common patterns
      for computing with lists.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's work through a concrete example to see this in action. We'll
      write a function <literal>render_table</literal> that, given a
      list of column headers and a list of rows, prints them out in a
      well formatted text table. So, if you were to write:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# printf &quot;%s\n&quot;
   (render_table
     [&quot;language&quot;;&quot;architect&quot;;&quot;first release&quot;]
     [ [&quot;Lisp&quot; ;&quot;John McCarthy&quot; ;&quot;1958&quot;] ;
       [&quot;C&quot;    ;&quot;Dennis Ritchie&quot;;&quot;1969&quot;] ;
       [&quot;ML&quot;   ;&quot;Robin Milner&quot;  ;&quot;1973&quot;] ;
       [&quot;OCaml&quot;;&quot;Xavier Leroy&quot;  ;&quot;1996&quot;] ;
     ]);;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      it would generate the following output.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
| language | architect      | first release |
|----------+----------------+---------------|
| Lisp     | John McCarthy  | 1958          |

</programlisting>
    <para>
      The first step is to write a function to compute the maximum width
      of each column of data. We can do this by converting the header
      and each row into a list of integer lengths, and then taking the
      element-wise max of those lists of lengths. Writing the code for
      all of this directly would be a bit of a chore, but we can do it
      quite concisely by making use of three functions from the
      <literal>List</literal> module: <literal>map</literal>,
      <literal>map2_exn</literal>, and <literal>fold</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>List.map</literal> is the simplest to explain. It takes a
      list and a function for transforming elements of that list, and
      returns a new list with the transformed elements. Thus, we can
      write:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map ~f:String.length [&quot;Hello&quot;; &quot;World!&quot;];;
- : int list = [5; 6]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>List.map2_exn</literal> is similar to
      <literal>List.map</literal>, except that it takes two lists and a
      function for combining them. Thus, we might write:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max [1;2;3] [3;2;1];;
- : int list = [3; 2; 3]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>_exn</literal> is there because the function throws
      an exception if the lists are of mismatched length.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max [1;2;3] [3;2;1;0];;
Exception: (Invalid_argument &quot;length mismatch in rev_map2_exn: 3 &lt;&gt; 4 &quot;).
</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>List.fold</literal> is the most complicated of the three,
      takin three arguments: a list to process, an initial accumulator
      value, and a function for updating the accumulator with the
      information from a list element. <literal>List.fold</literal>
      walks over the list from left to right, updating the accumulator
      at each step and returning the final value of the accumulator when
      it's done. You can see some of this by looking at the
      type-signature for <literal>fold</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.fold;;
- : 'a list -&gt; init:'accum -&gt; f:('accum -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'accum) -&gt; 'accum = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can use <literal>List.fold</literal> for something as simple as
      summing up a list:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) [1;2;3;4];;
- : int = 10
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This example is particularly simple because the accumulator and
      the list elements are of the same type. But
      <literal>fold</literal> is not limited to such cases. We can for
      example use <literal>fold</literal> to reverse a list, in which
      case the accumulator is itself a list.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.fold ~init:[] ~f:(fun list x -&gt; x :: list) [1;2;3;4];;
- : int list = [4; 3; 2; 1]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Let's bring our three functions together to compute the maximum
      column widths.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let max_widths header rows =
    let lengths l = List.map ~f:String.length l in
    List.fold rows
      ~init:(lengths header)
      ~f:(fun acc row -&gt;
        List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max acc (lengths row))
  ;;
val max_widths : string list -&gt; string list list -&gt; int list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Using <literal>List.map</literal> we define the function
      <literal>lengths</literal> which converts a list of strings to a
      list of integer lengths. <literal>List.fold</literal> is then used
      to iterate over the rows, using <literal>map2_exn</literal> to
      take the max of the accumulator with the lengths of the strings in
      each row of the table, with the accumulator initialized to the
      lengths of the header row.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now that we know how to compute column widths, we can write the
      code to generate the line that separates the header from the rest
      of the text table. We'll do this in part by mapping
      <literal>String.make</literal> over the lengths of the columns to
      generate a string of dashes of the appropriate length. We'll then
      join these sequences of dashes together using
      <literal>String.concat</literal>, which concatenates a list of
      strings with an optional separator string, and
      <literal>^</literal>, which is a pairwise string concatenation
      function, to add the delimiters on the outside.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let render_separator widths =
    let pieces = List.map widths
      ~f:(fun w -&gt; String.make (w + 2) '-')
    in
    &quot;|&quot; ^ String.concat ~sep:&quot;+&quot; pieces ^ &quot;|&quot;
  ;;
val render_separator : int list -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
# render_separator [3;6;2];;
- : string = &quot;|-----+--------+----|&quot;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that we make the line of dashes two larger than the provided
      width to provide some whitespace around each entry in the table.
    </para>
    <note>
    <title>
    Performance of <literal>String.concat</literal> and
    <literal>^</literal>
    </title>
    <para>
      In the above, we're using two different ways of concatenating
      strings, <literal>String.concat</literal>, which operates on lists
      of strings, and <literal>^</literal>, which is a pairwise
      operator. You should avoid <literal>^</literal> for joining long
      numbers of strings, since, it allocates a new string every time it
      runs. Thus, the following code:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let s = &quot;.&quot; ^ &quot;.&quot;  ^ &quot;.&quot;  ^ &quot;.&quot;  ^ &quot;.&quot;  ^ &quot;.&quot;  ^ &quot;.&quot;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      will allocate a string of length 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, whereas this
      code:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let s = String.concat [&quot;.&quot;;&quot;.&quot;;&quot;.&quot;;&quot;.&quot;;&quot;.&quot;;&quot;.&quot;;&quot;.&quot;]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      allocates one string of size 7, as well as a list of length 7. At
      these small sizes, the differences don't amount to much, but for
      assembling of large strings, it can be a serious performance
      issue.
    </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Now we need code for rendering a row with data in it. We'll first
      write a function <literal>pad</literal> for padding out a string
      to a specified length plus one blank space on either side.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let pad s length =
    &quot; &quot; ^ s ^ String.make (length - String.length s + 1) ' '
  ;;
val pad : string -&gt; int -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
# pad &quot;hello&quot; 10;;
- : string = &quot; hello      &quot;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can render a row of data by merging together the padded
      strings. Again, we'll use <literal>List.map2_exn</literal> for

        The example we worked through above only touched on three of the
        function in <literal>List</literal>. We won't cover the entire

        Very often when processing lists, one wants to restrict
        attention to just a subset of values. The
        <literal>List.filter</literal> function does just that.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

        Sometimes, you want to both transform and filter as part of the
        same computation. <literal>List.filter_map</literal> allows you
        to do just that. The following expression uses
        <literal>List.filter_map</literal> to produce the list of file
        extensions in the current directory, piping the results through
        <literal>List.dedup</literal> to remove duplicates. Note that
        this example also uses some functions from other modules,
        including <literal>Sys.ls_dir</literal> to get a directory
        listing, and <literal>String.rsplit2</literal> to split a string
        on the rightmost appearance ofa given character.
      </para>

        In the match statement above, you may notice that we for the
        first time used an underscore in a pattern match. You use an
        underscore when you want to indicate that the pattern doesn't
        depend on some sub-component of the data structure, but that you
        don't want to name it is an explicit variable.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another feature of OCaml's pattern language that we encounter
        here is <emphasis>or-patterns</emphasis>, which allow you to
        have multiple sub-patterns within a larger pattern. In this
        case, <literal>None | Some (&quot;&quot;,_)</literal> is an
        or-pattern. As we'll see later, or-patterns can be nested
        anywhere within larger patterns.

      <para>
        Another function that is similar to <literal>filter</literal> is
        <literal>partition_tf</literal>, which takes a list and
        partitions it into a pair of lists based on a boolean condition.
        <literal>tf</literal> is a mnemonic to remind the reader that
        <literal>true</literal> elements go to the first bucket and
        <literal>false</literal> ones go to the second. Thus, one could
        write:
      </para>

        Another very common operation on lists is concatenation. The
        list module actually comes with a few different ways of doing
        this. First, there's<literal>List.append</literal>, for
        concatenating a pair of lists.

- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
</programlisting>
      <para>
        <literal>@</literal> is just a synonym for
        <literal>List.append</literal>. In addition, there is
        <literal>List.concat</literal>, for concatenating a list of
        lists.
      </para>
      <para>
        <literal>ocaml # List.concat [[1;2];[3;4;5];[6];[]];; - : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]</literal>
        Here's an example of using <literal>List.concat</literal> along
        with <literal>List.map</literal> to compute a recursive listing
        of a directory tree.

      The only way to compute the length of an OCaml list is to walk the

      This looks simple enough, but you'll discover that this

      create the lists. <literal>List.init</literal> takes an integer
      <literal>n</literal> and a function <literal>f</literal> and

      To understand what went wrong, you need to learn a bit more about
      how function calls work. Typically, a function call needs some
      space to keep track of information associated with the call, such
      as the arguments passed to the function, or the location of the
      code that needs to start executing when the function call is
      complete. To allow for nested function calls, this information is
      typically organized in a stack, where a new <emphasis>stack
      frame</emphasis> is allocated for each nested function call, and
      then deallocated when the function call is complete.
    </para>
    <para>
      And that's the problem with our call to <literal>length</literal>:
      it tried to allocate ten million stack frames, which exhausted the
      available stack space. Happily, there's a way around this problem.
      Consider the following alternative implementation.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec length_plus_n l n =
    match l with
    | [] -&gt; n
    | _ :: tl -&gt; length_plus_n tl (n + 1)
  ;;
val length_plus_n : 'a list -&gt; int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# let length l = length_plus_n l 0 ;;
val length : 'a list -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
utop[41]&gt; length [1;2;3;4];;
- : int = 4
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This implementation depends on a helper function,
      <literal>length_plus_n</literal>, that computes the length of a
      given list plus a given <literal>n</literal>. In practice,
      <literal>n</literal> acts as an accumulator in which the answer is
      built up, step by step. As a result, we can do the additions along
      the way rather than doing them as we unwind the nested sequence of
      function calls, as we did in our first implemenation of
      <literal>length</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The advantage of this approach is that the recursive call in
      <literal>length_plus_n</literal> is a <emphasis>tail
      call</emphasis>. We'll explain more precisely what it means to be
      a tail call shortly, but the reason it's important is that tail
      calls don't require the allocation of a new stack frame, due to
      what is called the <emphasis>tail-call optimization</emphasis>. A
      recursive function is said to be <emphasis>tail
      recursive</emphasis> if all of its recursive calls are tail calls.
      <literal>length_plus_n</literal> is indeed tail recursive, and as
      a result, <literal>length</literal> can take a long list as input
      without blowing the stack.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# length (make_list 10_000_000);;
- : int = 10000000
</programlisting>
    <para>
      So when is a call a tail call? Let's think about the situation of
      one function (the <emphasis>caller</emphasis>) invokes another
      (the <emphasis>callee</emphasis>). The invocation is considered a
      tail call when the caller doesn't do anything with the value
      returned by the callee except to return it. The tail-call
      optimization makes sense because, when a caller makes a tail call,
      the caller's stack frame need never be used again, and so you
      don't need to keep it around. Thus, instead of allocating a new
      stack frame for the callee, the compiler is free to resuse the
      caller's stack frame.
    </para>
    <para>
      Tail recursion are important for more than just lists. Ordinary
      (non-tail) recursive calls are reasonable when the dealing with
      data-structures like binary trees where the depth of the tree is
      logarithmic in the size of your data. But when dealing with
      situations where the depth of the sequence of nested calls is on
      the order of the size of your data, tail recursion is usually the
      right approach.

    <title>More concise and faster patterns</title>
    <para>
      Now that we know more about how lists and patterns work, let's
      consider how we can improve on an example from
      (xref)(#recursive-list-functions): the function
      <literal>destutter</literal>, which removes sequential duplicates
      from a list. Here's the implementation that was described earlier.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec destutter list =
    match list with
    | [] -&gt; []
    | hd :: [] -&gt; hd :: []
    | hd :: hd' :: tl -&gt;
      if hd = hd' then destutter (hd' :: tl)
      else hd :: destutter (hd' :: tl)
  ;;
val destutter : 'a list -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We'll consider some ways of making this code more concise and more
      efficient.
    </para>
    <para>
      First, let's consider efficiency. One problem with the
      <literal>destutter</literal> code above is that it in some cases
      recreates on the right-hand side of the arrow a value that already
      existed on the left hand side. Thus, the pattern
      <literal>hd :: [] -&gt; hd :: []</literal> actually allocates a
      new list element, which really, it should be able to just return
      the list being matched. We can reduce allocation here by using an
      <literal>as</literal> pattern, which allows us to declare a name
      for the thing matched by a pattern or sub-pattern. While we're at
      it, we'll use the <literal>function</literal> keyword to eliminate
      the need for an explicit match.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec destutter = function
    | [] as l -&gt; l
    | _ :: [] as l -&gt; l
    | hd :: (hd' :: _ as tl) -&gt;
      if hd = hd' then destutter tl
      else hd :: destutter tl
  ;;
val destutter : 'a list -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can further collapse this by combining the first two cases into
      one, using an or-pattern. At the same time, we'll use the more
      concise <literal>[_]</literal> pattern to match a list with a
      single element, rather than <literal>_ :: []</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec destutter = function

      else hd :: destutter tl
  ;;
val destutter : 'a list -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can make the code slightly terser now by using a
      <literal>when</literal> clause. A <literal>when</literal> clause
      allows one to add an extra precondition on a pattern in the form
      of an arbitrary OCaml expression. In this case, we can use it to
      include the check on whether the first two elements are equal.

    Polymorphic compare
    </title>
    <para>
      In the <literal>destutter</literal> example above, we made use of
      the fact that OCaml lets us test equality between values of any
      type, using the <literal>=</literal> operator. Thus, we can write:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# 3 = 4;;
- : bool = false
# [3;4;5] = [3;4;5];;
- : bool = true
# [Some 3; None] = [None; Some 3];;
- : bool = false
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Indeed, if we look at the type of the equality operator, we'll see
      that it is polymorphic:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# (=);;
- : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      OCaml actually comes with a whole family of polymorphic comparison
      operators, including the standard infix comparators,
      <literal>&lt;</literal>, <literal>&gt;=</literal>,
      <emphasis>etc.</emphasis>, as well as the function
      <literal>compare</literal> that returns <literal>-1</literal>,
      <literal>0</literal> or <literal>1</literal> to flag whether the
      first operator is smaller than, equal to, or greater than the
      second, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      You might wonder how you could build function like these yourself
      if OCaml didn't come with them built-in. It turns out that you
      <emphasis>can't</emphasis> build these functions on your own.
      OCaml's polymorphic comparison functions are actually built-in to
      the runtime to a low level. These comparisons are polymorphic on
      the basis of ignoring almost everything about the types of the
      values that are being compared, paying attention only to the
      structure of the values as they're laid out in memory.
    </para>
    <para>
      Polymorphic compare does have some limitations. For example, they
      will fail at runtime if they encounter functions:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# (fun x -&gt; x + 1) = (fun x -&gt; x + 1);;
Exception: (Invalid_argument &quot;equal: functional value&quot;).
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Similarly, it will fail on values that come from outside the OCaml
      heap, like values from C-bindings. But they will work in a
      reasonable way for other kinds of values.
    </para>
    <para>
      For simple atomic types, polymorphic compare has the semantics you
      would expect: for floating point numbers and integer, polymorphic
      compare corresponds to the expected numerical comparison
      functions. For strings, it's a lexicographic comparison.
    </para>
    <para>
      Sometimes, however, the type-ignoring nature of polymorphic
      compare is a problem, particularly when you have your own notion
      of equality and ordering that you want to impose. We'll discuss
      this issue more, as well as some of the other downsides of
      polymorphic compare, in
      <xref linkend="maps-and-hashtables"/>.
    </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Note that <literal>when</literal> clauses have some downsides. As
      we noted earlier, the static checks associated with pattern
      matches rely on the fact that patterns are restricted in what they
      can express. Once we add the ability to add an arbitrary condition
      to a pattern, something will be lost. In particular, the ability
      for the compiler to determine if a match is exhaustive, or if some
      case is redundant, is compromised.
    </para>
    <para>
      Consider the following function which takes a list of optional
      values, and returns the number of those values that are
      <literal>Some</literal>. Because this implementation uses

  <para>
    We've so far experienced OCaml largely through the toplevel. As you
    move from exercises to real-world programs, you'll need to leave the
    toplevel behind and start building programs from files. Files are
    more than just a convenient way to store and manage your code; in
    OCaml, they also act as boundaries that divide your program into
    conceptual units.
  </para>
  <para>
    In this chapter, we'll show you how to build an OCaml program from a
    collection of files, as well as the basics of working with modules
    and module signatures.

    <para>
      We'll start with an example: a utility that reads lines from
      <literal>stdin</literal> and computes a frequency count of the
      lines that have been read in. At the end, the 10 lines with the
      highest frequency counts are written out. We'll start with a
      simple implementation, which we'll save as the file
      <literal>freq.ml</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      This implementation will use two functions from the
      <literal>List.Assoc</literal> module, which provides utility
      functions for interacting with association lists,
      <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, lists of key/value pairs. In
      particular, we use the function
      <literal>List.Assoc.find</literal>, which looks up a key in an
      association list, and <literal>List.add</literal>, which adds a
      new binding to an association list, as shown below.

      The function <literal>build_counts</literal> reads in lines from
      <literal>stdin</literal>, constructing from those lines an
      association list with the frequencies of each line. It does this
      by invoking <literal>In_channel.fold_lines</literal> (similar to
      the function <literal>List.fold</literal> described in
      <xref linkend="lists-and-patterns"/>), which reads
      through the lines one by one, calling the provided fold function
      for each line to update the accumulator. That accumulator is
      initialized to the empty list.
    </para>
    <para>
      With <literal>build_counts</literal> defined, we then call the
      function to build the association list, sort that list by
      frequency in descending order, grab the first 10 elements off the
      list, and then iterate over those ten elements and print them to
      the screen. These operations are tied together using the

    Where is the main function?

    <para>
      Unlike C, programs in OCaml do not have a unique
      <literal>main</literal> function. When an OCaml program is
      evaluated, all the statements in the implementation files are
      evaluated in order. These implementation files can contain
      arbitrary expressions, not just function definitions. In this
      example, the declaration starting with <literal>let () =</literal>
      plays the role of the <literal>main</literal> declaration, kicking
      off the processing. But really the entire file is evaluated at
      startup, and so in some sense the full codebase is one big
      <literal>main</literal> function.

      If we weren't using Core or any other external libraries, we could
      build the executable like this:

</programlisting>
    <para>
      But in this case, this command will fail with the error
      <literal>Unbound module Core</literal>. We need a somewhat more

    </para>
    <programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -linkpkg -thread -package core freq.ml -o freq
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Here we're using <literal>ocamlfind</literal>, a tool which itself
      invokes other parts of the ocaml toolchain (in this case,
      <literal>ocamlc</literal>) with the appropriate flags to link in
      particular libraries and packages. Here,
      <literal>-package core</literal> is asking
      <literal>ocamlfind</literal> to link in the Core library,
      <literal>-linkpkg</literal> is required to do the final linking in
      of packages for building a runnable executable, and
      <literal>-thread</literal> turns on threading support, which is
      required for Core.
    </para>
    <para>
      While this works well enough for a one-file project, more
      complicated builds will require a tool to orchestrate the build.
      One great tool for this task is <literal>ocamlbuild</literal>,
      which is shipped with the OCaml compiler. We'll talk more about
      <literal>ocamlbuild</literal> in
      <xref linkend="packaging"/>, but for now, we'll just
      walk through the steps required for this simple application.
      First, create a <literal>_tags</literal> file containing the
      following lines:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
true:package(core),thread,annot,debugging
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The purpose of the <literal>_tags</literal> file is to specify
      which compilation options are required for which files. In this
      case, we're telling <literal>ocamlbuild</literal> to link in the
      <literal>core</literal> package and to turn on threading,
      generation of annotation files, and debugging support for all
      files (since the condition <literal>true</literal> evaluates to
      <literal>true</literal> on all files).
    </para>
    <para>
      We can then invoke <literal>ocamlbuild</literal> to build the
      executable.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind freq.byte
</programlisting>
    <para>
      If we'd invoked <literal>ocamlbuild</literal> with a target of
      <literal>freq.native</literal> instead of
      <literal>freq.byte</literal>, we would have gotten native-code
      instead.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can now run the our program from the command-line. The
      following line extracts strings from the
      <literal>ocamlopt</literal> binary, reporting the most frequently
      occurring ones. Note that the specific results will very from
      platform to platform, since the binary itself will differ between
      platforms.

    Bytecode vs native code
    </title>
    <para>
      OCaml ships with two compilers: the <literal>ocamlc</literal>
      bytecode compiler and the <literal>ocamlopt</literal> native-code
      compiler. Programs compiled with <literal>ocamlc</literal> are
      interpreted by a virtual machine, while programs compiled with
      <literal>ocamlopt</literal> are compiled to native machine code to
      be run on a specific operating system and processor architecture.
    </para>
    <para>
      Aside from performance, executables generated by the two compilers
      have nearly identical behavior. There are a few things to be aware
      of. First, the bytecode compiler can be used on more
      architectures, and has some tools that are not available for
      native code. For example, the OCaml debugger only works with
      bytecode (although the <literal>gdb</literal>, the Gnu Debugger,
      works with OCaml native-code applications). The bytecode compiler
      is also quicker than the native-code compiler. In addition, in
      order to run a bytecode executable you typically need to have
      OCaml installed on the system in question. That's not strictly
      required, though, since you can build a bytecode executable with
      an embedded runtime, using the <literal>-custom</literal> compiler
      flag.
    </para>
    <para>
      As a general matter, production executables should usually be
      built using the native-code compiler, but it sometimes makes sense
      to use bytecode for development builds. And, of course, bytecode
      makes sense when targeting a platform not supported by the
      native-code compiler.

    <title>Multi-file programs and modules</title>
    <para>
      Source files in OCaml are tied into the module system, with each
      file compiling down into a module whose name is derived from the
      name of the file. We've encountered modules before, for example,
      when we used functions like <literal>find</literal> and
      <literal>add</literal> from the <literal>List.Assoc</literal>
      module. At it's simplest, you can think of a module as a
      collection of definitions that are stored within a namespace.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's consider how we can use modules to refactor the
      implementation of <literal>freq.ml</literal>. Remember that the
      variable <literal>counts</literal> contains an association list
      representing the counts of the lines seen so far. But updating an
      association list takes time linear in the length of the list,
      meaning that the time complexity of processing a file is quadratic
      in the number of distinct lines in the file.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can fix this problem by replacing association lists with a more
      efficient data structure. To do that, we'll first factor out the
      key functionality into a separate module with an explicit
      interface. We can consider alternative (and more efficient)
      implementations once we have a clear interface to program against.
    </para>
    <para>
      We'll start by creating a file, <literal>counter.ml</literal> that
      contains the logic for maintaining the association list used to
      describe the counts. The key function, called
      <literal>touch</literal>, updates the association list with the
      information that a given line should be added to the frequency
      counts.

      In our frequency-count example, the module
      <literal>Counter</literal> had an abstract type

      For example, imagine we wanted to add a function to
      <literal>Counter</literal> for returning the line with the median
      frequency count. If the number of lines is even, then there is no
      precise median and the function would return the lines before and
      after the median instead. We'll use a custom type to represent the
      fact that there are two possible return values. Here's a possible
      implementation.

      and types have distinct namespaces, so there's no name clash here.

      The decision of whether a given type should be abstract or

      enforce invariants beyond what is enforced by the type itself;

      files, like <literal>counter.ml</literal>. But modules (and module
      signatures) can be nested inside other modules. As a simple
      example, consider a program that needs to deal with multiple
      identifier like usernames and hostnames. If you just represent
      these as strings, then it becomes easy to confuse one with the
      other.
    </para>
    <para>
      A better approach is to mint new abstract types for each
      identifier, where those types are under the covers just
      implemented as strings. That way, the type system will prevent you
      from confusing a username with a hostname, and if you do need to
      convert, you can do so using explicit conversions to and from the
      string type.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's how you might create such an abstract type, within a
      sub-module:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
open Core.Std

module Username : sig
  type t
  val of_string : string -&gt; t
  val to_string : t -&gt; string
end = struct
  type t = string
  let of_string x = x
  let to_string x = x
end
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that the <literal>to_string</literal> and
      <literal>of_string</literal> functions above are implemented
      simply as the identity function, which means they have no runtime
      effect. They are there purely as part of the discipline that they
      enforce on the code through the type system.
    </para>
    <para>
      The basic structure of a module declaration like this is:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
module &lt;name&gt; : &lt;signature&gt; = &lt;implementation&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We could have written this slightly differently, by giving the
      signature its own toplevel <literal>module type</literal>
      declaration, making it possible to create multiple distinct types
      with the same underlying implementation in a lightweight way.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
open Core.Std

module type ID = sig
  type t
  val of_string : string -&gt; t
  val to_string : t -&gt; string
end

module String_id = struct
  type t = string
  let of_string x = x
  let to_string x = x
end

module Username : ID = String_id
module Hostname : ID = String_id

type session_info = { user: Username.t;
                      host: Hostname.t;
                      when_started: Time.t;
                    }

let sessions_have_same_user s1 s2 =
  s1.user = s2.host
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The above code has a fairly obvious bug, and indeed, the compiler
      will refuse to compile it, spitting out the following error.
    </para>

</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can also combine this with the use of the include statement to
      add some extra functionality to such a module. Thus, we could have
      rewritten the definition of <literal>Hostname</literal> above as
      follows to add a function <literal>Hostname.mine</literal> that
      returns the hostname of the present machine.

      One useful primitive in OCaml's module language is the
      <literal>open</literal> statement. We've seen that already in the

      So far, we've been referring to values and types within a module
      by using the module name as an explicit qualifier.
      <emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>, we write <literal>List.map</literal> to
      refer to the <literal>map</literal> function in the
      <literal>List</literal> module Sometimes, though, you want to be
      able to refer to the contents of a module without that kind of
      explicit qualification. This is what the <literal>open</literal>
      statement is for.
    </para>
    <para>
      We've already seen the <literal>open</literal> statement in use in
      the <literal>open Core.Std</literal> statements at the top of each
      source file. Opening a module adds its contents to the environment
      that the compiler looks in for finding identifiers. Here's a
      trivial example that gives you a sense of how this works.

    <para>
      <literal>open</literal> is essential when you want to modify your
      environment for a standard library like Core, but it's generally
      good style to keep opening of modules to a minimum. Opening a
      module is basically a tradeoff between terseness and explicitness
      --- the more modules you open, the harder it is to look at an
      identifier and figure out where it's defined.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's some general advice on how to deal with opens.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Opening modules at the toplevel of a module should be done
          quite sparingly, and generally only with modules that have
          been specifically designed to be opened, like
          <literal>Core.Std</literal> or
          <literal>Option.Monad_infix</literal>.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you do need to do an open, it's better to do a
          <emphasis>local open</emphasis>. There are two syntaxes for
          local opens. For example, you can write:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
let average x y =
  let open Int64 in
  x + y / of_int 2
</programlisting>
        <para>
          In the above, <literal>of_int</literal> and the infix
          operators are the ones from <literal>Int64</literal> module.
        </para>
        <para>
          There's another even more lightweight syntax for local opens,
          which is particularly useful for small expressions:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
let average x y =
  Int64.(x + y / of_int 2)
</programlisting>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          An alternative to local opens that makes your code terser
          without giving up on explicitness is to locally rebind the
          name of a module. So, instead of writing:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
let print_median m =
   match m with
   | Counter.Median string -&gt; printf &quot;True median:\n   %s\n&quot;
   | Counter.Before_and_after of before * after -&gt;
     printf &quot;Before and after median:\n   %s\n   %s\n&quot; before after
</programlisting>
        <para>
          you could write:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="ocaml">
let print_median m =
   let module C = Counter in
   match m with
   | C.Median string -&gt; printf &quot;True median:\n   %s\n&quot;
   | C.Before_and_after of before * after -&gt;
     printf &quot;Before and after median:\n   %s\n   %s\n&quot; before after
</programlisting>
        <para>
          Because the module name <literal>C</literal> only exists for a
          short scope, it's easy to read and remember what
          <literal>C</literal> stands for. Rebinding modules to very
          short names at the toplevel of your module is usually a
          mistake.

    <para>
      While opening a module affects the environment used to search for
      identifiers, <emphasis>including</emphasis> a module is a way of
      actually adding new identifiers to a module proper. Consider the
      following simple module for representing a range of intervals.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Interval = struct
    type t = | Interval of int * int

</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can use the <literal>include</literal> directive to create a

    <para>
      The difference between <literal>include</literal> and
      <literal>open</literal> is that we've done more than change how
      identifiers are searched for: we've changed what's in the module.
      If we'd used <literal>open</literal>, we'd have gotten a quite
      different result.

      To consider a more realistic example, imagine you wanted to build
      an extended version of the <literal>List</literal> module, where
      you've added some functionality not present in the module as
      distributed in Core. <literal>include</literal> allows us to do
      just that.

</programlisting>
    <para>
      Now, what about the interface of this new module? It turns out
      that include works on the signature language as well, so we can
      pull essentially the same trick to write an <literal>mli</literal>
      for this new module. The only trick is that we need to get our
      hands on the signature for the list module, which can be done
      using <literal>module type of</literal>.

      does not need to match the order of declarations in the
      <literal>ml</literal>. Also, the order of declarations in the
      <literal>ml</literal> is quite important in that it determines
      what values are shadowed. If we wanted to replace a function in
      <literal>List</literal> with a new function of the same name, the
      declaration of that function in the <literal>ml</literal> would
      have to come after the <literal>include List</literal>
      declaration.
    </para>
    <para>
      And we can now use <literal>Ext_list</literal> as a replacement
      for <literal>List</literal>. If we want to use
      <literal>Ext_list</literal> in preference to
      <literal>List</literal> in our project, we can create a file of
      common definitions:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

module List = Ext_list

    <para>
      And if we then put <literal>open Common</literal> after
      <literal>open Core.Std</literal> at the top of each file in our
      project, then references to <literal>List</literal> will
      automatically go to <literal>Ext_list</literal> instead.

        The simplest kind of error is where the type specified in the
        signature does not match up with the type in the implementation
        of the module. As an example, if we replace the
        <literal>val</literal> declaration in
        <literal>counter.mli</literal> by swapping the types of the
        first two arguments:

        and then try to compile <literal>Counter</literal> (by writing
        <literal>ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind counter.cmo</literal>. The
        <literal>cmo</literal> file is a compiled object file,

        This error message is a bit intimidating at first, and it takes
        a bit of thought to see why the first type for touch (which
        comes from the implementation) doesn't match the second one
        (which comes from the interface). The key thing to remember is
        that <literal>t</literal> is a
        <literal>Core.Std.Map.t</literal>, at which point you can see
        that the error is a mismatch in the order of arguments to

        There's no denying that learning to decode such error messages

        In most cases, OCaml doesn't allow circular dependencies,
        <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, a collection of definitions that all
        refer to each other. If you want to create such definitions, you
        typically have to mark them specially. For example, when

        of <literal>is_even</literal> and <literal>is_odd</literal> in

        The same is true at the module level. By default, circular

        The simplest case of this is that a module can not directly

    You might wonder how the compiler inferred that

    The hook that the compiler uses in this case to figure out the type
    is the record field name. Later in the chapter, we'll talk about
    what happens when there is more than one record type in scope with
    the same field name.

    When declaring an OCaml type, you always have the option of
    parameterizing it by a polymorphic type. Records are no different in
    this regard. So, for example, here's a type one might to timestamp
    arbitrary items.

type 'a timestamped = { item : 'a; time : Time.t; }

    We can then write polymorphic functions that operate over this

      Another way of getting information out of a record is by using a

      <literal>host_info_to_string</literal> below.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let host_info_to_string { hostname = h; os_name = os;
                            os_release = r; cpu_arch = c;
                            timestamp = ts;
                          } =
       sprintf &quot;%s (%s %s / %s, on %s)&quot; h os r c (Time.to_sec_string ts);;

</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that the pattern that we used had only a single case, rather
      than using several cases separated by <literal>|</literal>s. We
      needed only one pattern because record patterns are
      <emphasis>irrefutable</emphasis>, meaning that a record pattern
      match will never fail at runtime. This makes sense, because the
      set of fields available in a record is always the same. In
      general, patterns for types with a fixed structure, like records
      and tuples, are irrefutable, unlike types with variable structure
      like lists and variants.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another important characteristic of record patterns is that they
      don't need to be complete; a pattern can mention only a subset of
      the fields in the record. This can be convenient, but it can also
      be error prone. In particular, this means that when new fields are
      added to the record, code that should be updated to react to the
      presence of those new fields will not be flagged by the compiler.
    </para>
    <para>
      As an example, imagine that we wanted to add a new field to our
      <literal>host_info</literal> record called
      <literal>os_version</literal>, as shown below.

      The code for <literal>host_info_to_string</literal> would continue

      clear that you might want to update
      <literal>host_info_to_string</literal> in order to include
      <literal>os_version</literal>, and it would be nice if the type
      system would give you a warning about the change.
    </para>
    <para>
      Happily, OCaml does offer an optional warning for missing fields
      in a record pattern. With that warning turned on (which you can do
      in the toplevel by typing
      <literal>#warnings &quot;+9&quot;</literal>), the compiler will
      warn about the missing field.

Warning 9: the following labels are not bound in this record pattern:
os_version
Either bind these labels explicitly or add '; _' to the pattern.
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can disable the warning for a given pattern by explicitly
      acknowledging that we are ignoring extra fields. This is done by
      adding an underscore to the pattern, as shown below.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

    <title>Field punning</title>
    <para>
      When the name of a variable coincides with the name of a record
      field, OCaml provides some handy syntactic shortcuts. For example,
      the pattern in the following function binds all of the fields in
      question to variables of the same name. This is called
      <emphasis>field punning</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <title>Reusing field names</title>
    <para>
      Defining records with the same field names can be problematic.
      Let's consider a simple example: building types to represent the
      protocol used for a logging server.
    </para>
    <para>
      We'll describe three message types: <literal>log_entry</literal>,
      <literal>heartbeat</literal> and <literal>logon</literal>. The
      <literal>log_entry</literal> message is used to deliver a log
      entry to the server; the <literal>logon</literal> message is sent
      to initiate a connection, and includes the identity of the user
      connecting and credentials used for authentication; and the
      <literal>heartbeat</literal> message is periodically sent by the
      client to demonstrate to the server that the client is alive and
      connected. All of these messages include a session id and the time
      the message was generated.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type log_entry =
    { session_id: string;
      time: Time.t;
      important: bool;
      message: string;
    }
  type heartbeat =
    { session_id: string;
      time: Time.t;
      status_message: string;
    }
  type logon =
    { session_id: string;
      time: Time.t;
      user: string;
      credentials: string;
    }
;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Reusing field names can lead to some ambiguity. For example, if we
      want to write a function to grab the session_id from a record,
      what type will it have?
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let get_session_id t = t.session_id;;
val get_session_id : logon -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In this case, OCaml just picks the most recent definition of that
      record field. We can force OCaml to assume we're dealing with a
      different type (say, a <literal>heartbeat</literal>) using a type
      annotation.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let get_heatbeat_session_id (t:heartbeat) = t.session_id;;
val get_heatbeat_session_id : heartbeat -&gt; string = &lt;funambulate&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      While it's possible to resolve ambiguous field names using type
      annotations, the ambiguity can be a bit confusing. Consider the
      following functions for grabbing the session id and status from a
      heartbeat.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let status_and_session t = (t.status_message, t.session_id);;
val status_and_session : heartbeat -&gt; string * string = &lt;fun&gt;
# let session_and_status t = (t.session_id, t.status_message);;
Error: The record type logon has no field status_message
# let session_and_status (t:heartbeat) = (t.session_id, t.status_message);;
val session_and_status : heartbeat -&gt; string * string = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Why did the first definition succeed without a type annotation and
      the second one fail? The difference is that in the first case, the
      type-checker considered the <literal>status_message</literal>
      field first and thus concluded that the record was a
      <literal>heartbeat</literal>. When the order was switched, the
      <literal>session_id</literal> field was considered first, and so
      that drove the type to be considered to be a
      <literal>logon</literal>, at which point
      <literal>t.status_message</literal> no longer made sense.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can avoid this ambiguity altogether, either by using
      non-overlapping field names or, more generally, by minting a
      module for each type. Packing types into modules is a broadly
      useful idiom (and one used quite extensively by Core), providing
      for each type a name-space within which to put related values.
      When using this style, it is standard practice to name the type
      associated with the module <literal>t</literal>. Using this style
      we would write:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Log_entry = struct
    type t =
      { session_id: string;
        time: Time.t;
        important: bool;
        message: string;
      }
  end
  module Heartbeat = struct
    type t =
      { session_id: string;
        time: Time.t;
        status_message: string;
      }
  end
  module Logon = struct
    type t =
      { session_id: string;
        time: Time.t;
        user: string;
        credentials: string;
      }
  end;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Now, our heartbeat-creation function can be rendered as follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let create_log_entry ~session_id ~important message =
     { Log_entry.time = Time.now (); Log_entry.session_id;
       Log_entry.important; Log_entry.message }
  ;;
val create_log_entry :
  session_id:string -&gt; important:bool -&gt; string -&gt; Log_entry.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The module name <literal>Log_entry</literal> is required to
      qualify the fields, because this function is outside of the
      <literal>Log_entry</literal> module where the record was defined.
      OCaml only requires the module qualification for one record field,
      however, so we can write this more concisely. Note that we are
      allowed to insert whitespace between the module-path and the field
      name.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let create_log_entry ~session_id ~important message =
     { Log_entry.
       time = Time.now (); session_id; important; message }
  ;;
val create_log_entry :
  session_id:string -&gt; important:bool -&gt; string -&gt; Log_entry.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This is not restricted to constructing a record; we can use the
      same trick when pattern matching.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let message_to_string { Log_entry.important; message; _ } =
    if important then String.uppercase message else message
  ;;
val message_to_string : Log_entry.t -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      When using dot-notation for accessing record fields, we can
      qualify the field by the module directly.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let is_important t = t.Log_entry.important;;
val is_important : Log_entry.t -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The syntax here is a little surprising when you first encounter
      it. The thing to keep in mind is that the dot is being used in two
      ways: the first dot is a record field access, with everything to
      the right of the dot being interpreted as a field name; the second
      dot is accessing the contents of a module, referring to the record
      field <literal>important</literal> from within the module
      <literal>Log_entry</literal>. The fact that
      <literal>Log_entry</literal> is capitalized and so can't be a
      field name is what disambiguates the two uses.
    </para>
    <para>
      For functions defined within the module where a given record is
      defined, the module qualification goes away entirely.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="functional-updates">
    <title>Functional updates</title>
    <para>
      Fairly often, you will find yourself wanting to create a new
      record that differs from an existing record in only a subset of
      the fields. For example, imagine our logging server had a record
      type for representing the state of a given client, including when
      the last heartbeat was received from that client. The following
      defines a type for representing this information, as well as a
      function for updating the client information when a new heartbeat
      arrives.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type client_info =
   { addr: Unix.Inet_addr.t;

      This is fairly verbose, given that there's only one field that we
      actually want to change, and all the others are just being copied
      over from <literal>t</literal>. We can use OCaml's
      <emphasis>functional update</emphasis> syntax to do this more
      tersely. The syntax of a functional update is as follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The purpose of the functional update is to create a new record
      based on an existing one, with a set of field changes layered on
      top.
    </para>
    <para>
      Given this, we can rewrite <literal>register_heartbeat</literal>
      more concisely.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let register_heartbeat t hb =

</programlisting>
    <para>
      Functional updates make your code independent of the identity of
      the fields in the record that are not changing. This is often what
      you want, but it has downsides as well. In particular, if you
      change the definition of your record to have more fields, the type
      system will not prompt you to reconsider whether your update code
      should affect those fields. Consider what happens if we decided to
      add a field for the status message received on the last heartbeat.

      The original implementation of

      Like most OCaml values, records are immutable by default. You can,
      however, declare individual record fields as mutable. For example,
      we could take the <literal>client_info</literal> type and make the
      fields that may need to change over time mutable, as follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type client_info =
   { addr: Unix.Inet_addr.t;
     port: int;
     user: string;
     credentials: string;
     mutable last_heartbeat_time: Time.t;
     mutable last_heartbeat_status: string;
   };;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We then use the <literal>&lt;-</literal> operator for actually
      changing the state. The side-effecting version of
      <literal>register_heartbeat</literal> would be written as follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let register_heartbeat t hb =
    t.last_heartbeat_time   &lt;- hb.Heartbeat.time;
    t.last_heartbeat_status &lt;- hb.Heartbeat.status_message
  ;;
val register_heartbeat : client_info -&gt; Heartbeat.t -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that mutable assignment, and thus the
      <literal>&lt;-</literal> operator, is not needed for
      initialization, because all fields of a record, including mutable
      ones, are specified when the record is created.
    </para>
    <para>
      OCaml's policy of immutable-by-default is a good one, but
      imperative programming does have its place. We'll discuss more
      about how (and when) to use OCaml's imperative features in
      <xref linkend="imperative-programming"/>.

    <para>
      Consider the following function for extracting the usernames from
      a list of <literal>Logon</literal> messages.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let get_users logons =
     List.dedup (List.map logons ~f:(fun x -&gt; x.Logon.user));;
val get_users : Logon.t list -&gt; string list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Here, we wrote a small function
      <literal>(fun x -&gt; x.Logon.user)</literal> to access the
      <literal>user</literal> field. This kind of accessor function is a
      common enough pattern that that it would be convenient to generate
      them automatically. The <literal>fieldslib</literal> syntax
      extension that ships with <literal>Core</literal> does just that.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can enable the syntax extension by typing
      <literal>#require &quot;fieldslib.syntax&quot;</literal> into the
      top-level, at which point the <literal>with fields</literal>
      annotation at the end of the declaration of a record type will
      cause the extension to be applied to a given type declaration. So,
      for example, we could have defined <literal>Logon</literal> as
      follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# #require &quot;fieldslib.syntax&quot;;;
# module Logon = struct
    type t =
      { session_id: string;
        time: Time.t;
        user: string;
        credentials: string;
      }
    with fields
  end;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that this will generate a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of output,
      because <literal>fieldslib</literal> generates a large collection
      of helper functions for working with record fields. We'll only
      discuss a few of these; you can learn about the remainder from the
      documentation that comes with <literal>fieldslib</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      One of the functions we obtain is <literal>Logon.user</literal>,
      which we can use to extract the user field from a logon message.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let get_users logons = List.dedup (List.map logons ~f:Logon.user);;
val get_users : Logon.t list -&gt; string list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In addition to generating field accessor functions,
      <literal>fieldslib</literal> also creates a sub-module called
      <literal>Fields</literal> that contains a first class
      representative of each field, in the form of a value of type
      <literal>Field.t</literal>. The <literal>Field</literal> module
      provides the following functions:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>Field.name</literal>, which returns the name of a
          field
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>Field.get</literal>, which returns the content of a
          field
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>Field.fset</literal>, which does a functional update
          of a field
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>Field.setter</literal>, which returns
          <literal>None</literal> if the field is not mutable or
          <literal>Some f</literal> if it is, where <literal>f</literal>
          is a function for mutating that field.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      A <literal>Field.t</literal> has two type parameters: the first
      for the type of the record, and the second for the type of the
      field in question. Thus, the type of
      <literal>Logon.Fields.session_id</literal> is
      <literal>(Logon.t, string) Field.t</literal>, whereas the type of
      <literal>Logon.Fields.time</literal> is
      <literal>(Logon.t, Time.t) Field.t</literal>. Thus, if you call
      <literal>Field.get</literal> on
      <literal>Logon.Fields.user</literal>, you'll get a function for
      extracting the <literal>user</literal> field from a
      <literal>Logon.t</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Field.get Logon.Fields.user;;
- : Logon.t -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Thus, first parameter of the <literal>Field.t</literal>
      corresponds to the record you pass to <literal>get</literal>, and
      the second argument corresponds to the value contained in the
      field, which is also the return type of <literal>get</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The type of <literal>Field.get</literal> is a little more
      complicated than you might naively expect from the above, as you
      can see below.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Field.get;;
- : ('b, 'r, 'a) Field.t_with_perm -&gt; 'r -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The type is <literal>Field.t_with_perm</literal> rather than a
      simple <literal>Field.t</literal> because fields have a notion of
      access control associated with them because there are some special
      cases where we may expose a field but not expose the ability to
      read a field but not the ability to do a functional update.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can use first class fields to do things like write a generic
      function for displaying a record field.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let show_field field to_string record =
    let name = Field.name field in
    let field_string = to_string (Field.get field record) in
    name ^ &quot;: &quot; ^ field_string
  ;;
val show_field : ('a, 'b) Field.t -&gt; ('b -&gt; string) -&gt; 'a -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This takes three arguments: the <literal>Field.t</literal>, a
      function for converting the contents of the field in question to a
      string, and a record from which the field can be grabbed.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's an example of <literal>show_field</literal> in action.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let logon = { Logon.
                session_id = &quot;26685&quot;;
                time = Time.now ();
                user = &quot;yminsky&quot;;
                credentials = &quot;Xy2d9W&quot;; }
  ;;
# show_field Logon.Fields.user Fn.id logon;;
- : string = &quot;user: yminsky&quot;
# show_field Logon.Fields.time Time.to_string logon;;
- : string = &quot;time: 2012-06-26 18:44:13.807826&quot;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      As a side note, the above is our first use of the
      <literal>Fn</literal> module (short for &quot;function&quot;)
      which provides a collection of useful primitives for dealing with
      functions. <literal>Fn.id</literal> is the identity function.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>fieldslib</literal> also provides higher-level operators,
      like <literal>Fields.fold</literal> and
      <literal>Fields.iter</literal>, which let you iterate over all the
      fields of a record. So, for example, in the case of
      <literal>Logon.t</literal>, the field iterator has the following
      type.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Logon.Fields.iter;;
- : session_id:(([&lt; `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, string)
                Field.t_with_perm -&gt; unit) -&gt;
    time:(([&lt; `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, Time.t) Field.t_with_perm -&gt;
          unit) -&gt;
    user:(([&lt; `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, string) Field.t_with_perm -&gt;
          unit) -&gt;
    credentials:(([&lt; `Read | `Set_and_create ], Logon.t, string)
                 Field.t_with_perm -&gt; unit) -&gt;
    unit
= &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This is a bit daunting to look at, largely because of the access
      control markers, but the structure is actually pretty simple. Each
      labeled argument is a function that takes a first-class field of
      the necessary type as an argument. Note that
      <literal>iter</literal> passes each of these callbacks the
      <literal>Field.t</literal>, not the contents of the specific
      record field. The contents of the field, though, can be looked up
      using the combiation of the record and the
      <literal>Field.t</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, let's use <literal>Logon.Fields.iter</literal> and
      <literal>show_field</literal> to print out all the fields of a
      <literal>Logon</literal> record.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let print_logon logon =
    let print to_string field =
      printf &quot;%s\n&quot; (show_field field to_string logon)
    in
    Logon.Fields.iter
      ~session_id:(print Fn.id)
      ~time:(print Time.to_string)
      ~user:(print Fn.id)
      ~credentials:(print Fn.id)
  ;;
val print_logon : Logon.t -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;
# print_logon logon;;
session_id: 26685
time: 2012-06-26 18:44:13.807826
user: yminsky
credentials: Xy2d9W
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
    <para>
      One nice side effect of this approach is that it helps you adapt
      your code when the fields of a record change. If you were to add a
      field to <literal>Logon.t</literal>, the type of
      <literal>Logon.Fields.iter</literal> would change along with it,
      acquiring a new argument. Any code using
      <literal>Logon.Fields.iter</literal> won't compile until it's
      fixed to take this new argument into account.
    </para>
    <para>
      This exhaustion guarntee is a valuable one. Field iterators are
      useful for a variety of record-related tasks, from building record
      validation functions to scaffolding the definition of a web-form
      from a record type, and such applications can benefit from the
      guarantee that all fields of the record type in question have been
      considered.

  <title>Variants</title>
  <para>
    Variant types are one of the most useful features of OCaml, and also
    one of the most unusual. They let you represent data that may take
    on multiple different forms, where each form is marked by an
    explicit tag. As we'll see, when combined with pattern matching,
    variants give you a powerful way of representing complex data and of
    organizing the case-analysis on that information.
  </para>
  <para>
    Let's consider a concrete example of how variants can be useful.
    Almost all terminals support a set of 8 basic colors, and we can
    represent those colors using a variant. Each color is declared as a
    simple tag, with pipes used to separate the different cases. Note
    that variant tags must be capitalized.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type basic_color =
    Black | Red | Green | Yellow | Blue | Magenta | Cyan | White ;;
# Cyan ;;
- : basic_color = Cyan
# [Blue; Magenta; Red] ;;
- : basic_color list = [Blue; Magenta; Red]
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The following function uses pattern matching to convert a
    <literal>basic_color</literal> to a corresponding integer. The
    exhaustiveness checking on pattern matches means that the compiler
    will warn us if we miss a color.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let basic_color_to_int = function
  | Black -&gt; 0 | Red     -&gt; 1 | Green -&gt; 2 | Yellow -&gt; 3
  | Blue  -&gt; 4 | Magenta -&gt; 5 | Cyan  -&gt; 6 | White  -&gt; 7 ;;
val basic_color_to_int : basic_color -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# List.map ~f:basic_color_to_int [Blue;Red];;
- : int list = [4; 1]
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Using the above, we can generate escape codes to change the color of
    a given string displayed in a terminal.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let color_by_number number text =
    sprintf &quot;\027[38;5;%dm%s\027[0m&quot; number text;;
  val color_by_number : int -&gt; string -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
# let blue = color_by_number (basic_color_to_int Blue) &quot;Blue&quot;;;
val blue : string = &quot;\027[38;5;4mBlue\027[0m&quot;
# printf &quot;Hello %s World!\n&quot; blue;;
Hello Blue World!
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
  <para>
    On most terminals, that word &quot;Blue&quot; will be rendered in
    blue.
  </para>
  <para>
    In this example, the cases of the variant are simple tag with no
    associated data. This is substantively the same as the enumerations
    found in languages like C and Java. But as we'll see, variants can
    do considerably more than represent a simple enumeration. Indeed, an
    enumeration isn't enough to effectively describe the full set of
    colors that a modern terminal can display. Many terminals, including
    the venerable <literal>xterm</literal>, support 256 different
    colors, broken up into the following groups.
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The 8 basic colors, in regular and bold versions.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        A 6 × 6 × 6 RGB color cube
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        A 24-level grayscale ramp
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    We'll also represent this more complicated color-space as a variant,
    but this time, the different tags will have arguments which describe
    the data available in each case. Note that variants can have
    multiple arguments, which are separated by <literal>*</literal>'s.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type weight = Regular | Bold
  type color =
  | Basic of basic_color * weight (* basic colors, regular and bold *)
  | RGB   of int * int * int       (* 6x6x6 color cube *)
  | Gray  of int                   (* 24 grayscale levels *)

# [RGB (250,70,70); Basic (Green, Regular)];;
- : color list = [RGB (250, 70, 70); Basic (Green, Regular)]
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Once again, we'll use pattern matching to convert a color to a
    corresponding integer. But in this case, the pattern matching does
    more than separate out the different cases; it also allows us to
    extract the data associated with each tag.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let color_to_int = function
    | Basic (basic_color,weight) -&gt;
      let base = match weight with Bold -&gt; 8 | Regular -&gt; 0 in
      base + basic_color_to_int basic_color

    | Gray i -&gt; 232 + i ;;
val color_to_int : color -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Now, we can print text using the full set of available colors.

# color_print (Basic (Red,Bold)) &quot;A bold red!&quot;;;

  Catch-all cases and refactoring

  <para>
    OCaml's type system can act as a refactoring tool, by warning you of
    places where your code needs to be updated to match an interface
    change. This is particularly valuable in the context of variants.

  <para>
    We've essentially broken out the <literal>Basic</literal> case into
    two cases, <literal>Basic</literal> and <literal>Bold</literal>, and
    <literal>Basic</literal> has changed from having two arguments to
    one. <literal>color_to_int</literal> as we wrote it still expects
    the old structure of the variant, and if we try to compile that same
    code again, the compiler will notice the discrepancy.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">

  <para>
    As we've seen, the type errors identified the things that needed to
    be fixed to complete the refactoring of the code. This is
    fantastically useful, but for it to work well and reliably, you need
    to write your code in a way that maximizes the compiler's chances of
    helping you find the bugs. To this end, a useful rule of thumb is to
    avoid catch-all cases in pattern matches.
  </para>
  <para>
    Here's an example that illustrates how catch-all cases interact with
    exhaustion checks. Imagine we wanted a version of
    <literal>color_to_int</literal> that works on older terminals by
    rendering the first 16 colors (the 8 <literal>basic_color</literal>s
    in regular and bold) in the normal way, but rendering everything
    else as white. We might have written the function as follows.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let oldschool_color_to_int = function
    | Basic (basic_color,weight) -&gt;
      let base = match weight with Bold -&gt; 8 | Regular -&gt; 0 in
      base + basic_color_to_int basic_color
    | _ -&gt; basic_color_to_int White;;
val oldschool_color_to_int : color -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    But because the catch-all case encompasses all possibilities, the
    type system will no longer warn us that we have missed the new
    <literal>Bold</literal> case when we change the type to include it.
    We can get this check back by being avoiding the catch-all case, and
    instead being explicit about the tags that are ignored.

      In particular, a single <literal>Log_entry.t</literal> has a
      <literal>session_id</literal> <emphasis>and</emphasis> a
      <literal>time</literal> <emphasis>and</emphasis> an
      <literal>important</literal> flag <emphasis>and</emphasis> a
      <literal>message</literal>. More generally, you can think of
      record types as acting as conjunctions. Variants, on the other
      hand, are disjunctions, letting you represent multiple
      possibilities, as in the following example.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type client_message = | Logon of Logon.t
                        | Heartbeat of Heartbeat.t
                        | Log_entry of Log_entry.t
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      A <literal>client_message</literal> is a <literal>Logon</literal>
      <emphasis>or</emphasis> a <literal>Heartbeat</literal>
      <emphasis>or</emphasis> a <literal>Log_entry</literal>. If we want
      to write code that processes messages generically, rather than
      code specialized to a fixed message type, we need something like
      <literal>client_message</literal> to act as one overarching type
      for the different possible messages. We can then match on the
      <literal>client_message</literal> to determine the type of the
      particular message being dealt with.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can increase the precision of your types by using variants to
      represent differences between types, and records to represent
      shared structure. Consider the following function that takes a
      list of <literal>client_message</literal>s and returns all
      messages generated by a given user. The code in question is
      implemented by folding over the list of messages, where the
      accumulator is a pair of:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          the set of session identifiers for the user that have been
          seen thus far.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          the set of messages so far that are associated with the user.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Here's the concrete code.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let messages_for_user user messages =
    let (user_messages,_) =
      List.fold messages ~init:([],String.Set.empty)
        ~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) message -&gt;
          match message with
          | Logon m -&gt;
            if m.Logon.user = user then
              (message::messages, Set.add user_sessions m.Logon.session_id)
            else acc
          | Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ -&gt;
            let session_id = match message with
              | Logon     m -&gt; m.Logon.session_id
              | Heartbeat m -&gt; m.Heartbeat.session_id
              | Log_entry m -&gt; m.Log_entry.session_id
            in
            if Set.mem user_sessions session_id then
              (message::messages,user_sessions)
            else acc
        )
    in
    List.rev user_messages
  ;;
val messages_for_user : string -&gt; client_message list -&gt; client_message list =
  &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      There's one awkward bit about the code above, which is the
      calculation of the session ids. In particular, we have the
      following repetitive snippet of code:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
  let session_id = match message with
    | Logon     m -&gt; m.Logon.session_id
    | Heartbeat m -&gt; m.Heartbeat.session_id
    | Log_entry m -&gt; m.Log_entry.session_id
  in
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This code effectively computes the session id for each underlying
      message type. The repetition in this case isn't that bad, but
      would become problematic in larger and more complicated examples.
      Also, we had to include code for the <literal>Logon</literal>
      case, even though it can't actually come up.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can improve the code by refactoring our types to explicitly
      separate the parts that are shared from those that are common. The
      first step is to cut down the definitions of the per-message
      records to just contain the unique components of each message.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Log_entry = struct
    type t = { important: bool;
               message: string;
             }
  end

  module Heartbeat = struct
    type t = { status_message: string; }
  end

  module Logon = struct
    type t = { user: string;
               credentials: string;
             }
  end
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can then define a variant type that covers the different
      possible unique components.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type details =
  | Logon of Logon.t
  | Heartbeat of Heartbeat.t
  | Log_entry of Log_entry.t
 ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Separately, we need a record that contains the fields that are
      common across all messages.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Common = struct
    type t = { session_id: string;
               time: Time.t;
             }
  end
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      A full message can then be represented as a pair of a
      <literal>Common.t</literal> and a <literal>details</literal>.
      Using this, we can rewrite our example above as follows:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let messages_for_user user messages =
    let (user_messages,_) =
      List.fold messages ~init:([],String.Set.empty)
        ~f:(fun ((messages,user_sessions) as acc) ((common,details) as message) -&gt;
          let session_id = common.Common.session_id in
          match details with
          | Logon m -&gt;
            if m.Logon.user = user then
              (message::messages, Set.add user_sessions session_id)
            else acc
          | Heartbeat _ | Log_entry _ -&gt;
            if Set.mem user_sessions session_id then
              (message::messages,user_sessions)
            else acc
        )
    in
    List.rev user_messages
  ;;
val messages_for_user :
  string -&gt; (Common.t * details) list -&gt; (Common.t * details) list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that the more complex match statement for computing the
      session id has been replaced with the simple expression
      <literal>common.Common.session_id</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      In addition, this design allows us to essentially downcast to the
      specific message type once we know what it is, and then dispatch
      code to handle just that message type. In particular, while we use
      the type <literal>Common.t * details</literal> to represent an
      arbitrary message, we can use
      <literal>Common.t * Logon.t</literal> to represent a logon
      message. Thus, if we had functions for handling individual message
      types, we could write a dispatch function as follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let handle_message server_state (common,details) =
    match details with
    | Log_entry m -&gt; handle_log_entry server_state (common,m)
    | Logon     m -&gt; handle_logon     server_state (common,m)
    | Heartbeat m -&gt; handle_heartbeat server_state (common,m)
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      And it's explicit at the type level that
      <literal>handle_log_entry</literal> sees only
      <literal>Log_entry</literal> messages,
      <literal>handle_logon</literal> sees only <literal>Logon</literal>
      messages, etc.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="variants-and-recursive-data-structures">
    <title>Variants and recursive data structures</title>
    <para>
      Another common application of variants is to represent tree-like
      recursive data structures. We'll show how this can be done by
      walking through the design of a simple Boolean expression
      language. Such a language can be useful anywhere you need to
      specify filters, which are used in everything from packet
      analyzers to mail clients.
    </para>
    <para>
      An expression in this language will be defined by the variant
      <literal>blang</literal> (short for &quot;Boolean language&quot;)
      with one tag for each kind of expression we want to support.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type 'a blang =
  | Base  of 'a
  | Const of bool
  | And   of 'a blang list
  | Or    of 'a blang list
  | Not   of 'a blang
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that the definition of the type <literal>blang</literal> is
      recursive, meaning that a <literal>blang</literal> may contain
      other <literal>blang</literal>s. Also, <literal>blang</literal> is
      parameterized by a polymorphic type <literal>'a</literal> which is
      used for specifying the type of the value that goes under the
      <literal>Base</literal> tag.
    </para>
    <para>
      The purpose of each tag is pretty straightforward.
      <literal>And</literal>, <literal>Or</literal> and
      <literal>Not</literal> are the basic operators for building up
      Boolean expressions, and <literal>Const</literal> lets you enter
      the constants <literal>true</literal> and
      <literal>false</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>Base</literal> tag is what allows you to tie the
      <literal>blang</literal> to your application, by letting you
      specify an element of some base predicate type, whose truth or
      falsehood is determined by your application. If you were writing a
      filter language for an email processor, your base predicates might
      specify the tests you would run against an email, as in the
      following example.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type mail_field = To | From | CC | Date | Subject
  type mail_predicate = { field: mail_field;
                          contains: string }
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Using the above, we can construct a simple expression with
      <literal>mail_predicate</literal> as its base predicate.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let test field contains = Base { field; contains };;
val test : mail_field -&gt; string -&gt; mail_predicate blang = &lt;fun&gt;
# And [ Or [ test To &quot;doligez&quot;; test CC &quot;doligez&quot; ];
        test Subject &quot;runtime&quot;;
      ]
  ;;
- : mail_predicate blang =
And
 [Or
   [Base {field = To; contains = &quot;doligez&quot;};
    Base {field = CC; contains = &quot;doligez&quot;}];
  Base {field = Subject; contains = &quot;runtime&quot;}]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Being able to construct such expressions isn't enough; we also
      need to be able to evaluate such an expression. The following code
      shows how you could write a general-purpose evaluator for
      <literal>blang</literal>s.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec eval blang base_eval =
    (* a shortcut, so we don't need to repeatedly pass [base_eval]
       explicitly to [eval] *)
    let eval' blang = eval blang base_eval in
    match blang with
    | Base  base   -&gt; base_eval base
    | Const bool   -&gt; bool
    | And   blangs -&gt; List.for_all blangs ~f:eval'
    | Or    blangs -&gt; List.exists  blangs ~f:eval'
    | Not   blang  -&gt; not (eval' blang)
  ;;
val eval : 'a blang  -&gt; ('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The structure of the code is pretty straightforward --- we're just
      pattern matching over the structure of the data, doing the
      appropriate calculation based on which tag we see. To use this
      evaluator on a concrete example, we just need to write the
      <literal>base_eval</literal> function which is capable of
      evaluating a base predicate.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another useful operation on expressions is simplification. The
      following function applies some basic simplification rules, most
      of which are driven by the presence of constants.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec simplify = function
    | Base _ | Const _ as x -&gt; x
    | And blangs -&gt;
      let blangs =
        List.map ~f:simplify blangs
        |&gt; List.filter ~f:(fun x -&gt; x &lt;&gt; Const true)
      in
      if List.is_empty blangs then Const true
      else if List.exists blangs ~f:(fun x -&gt; x = Const false)
      then Const false
      else And blangs
    | Or blangs -&gt;
      let blangs =
        List.map ~f:simplify blangs
        |&gt; List.filter ~f:(fun x -&gt; x &lt;&gt; Const false)
      in
      if List.is_empty blangs then Const false
      else if List.exists blangs ~f:(fun x -&gt; x = Const true)
      then Const true
      else Or blangs
    | Not blang -&gt;
      match simplify blang with
      | Const bool -&gt; Const (not bool)
      | blang -&gt; Not blang
  ;;
val simplify : 'a blang -&gt; 'a blang = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      One thing to notice about the above code is that it uses a
      catch-all case in the very last line within the
      <literal>Not</literal> case. It's generally better to be explicit
      about the cases you're ignoring. Indeed, if we change this snippet
      of code to be more explicit:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
    | Not blang -&gt;
      match simplify blang with
      | Const bool -&gt; Const (not bool)
      | (And _ | Or _ | Base _ | Not _) -&gt; Not blang
</programlisting>
    <para>
      it's easy to see that we've missed an important case:
      double-negation.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
    | Not blang -&gt;
      match simplify blang with
      | Const b -&gt; Const (not b)
      | Not blang -&gt; blang
      | (And _ | Or _ | Base _ ) -&gt; Not blang
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This example is more than a toy. There's a module very much in
      this spirit in Core called <literal>Blang</literal>, and it gets a
      lot of practical use in a variety of applications.
    </para>
    <para>
      More generally, using variants to build recursive data structures
      is a common technique, and shows up everywhere from designing
      little languages to building efficient data structures.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="polymorphic-variants">
    <title>Polymorphic variants</title>
    <para>
      In addition to the ordinary variants we've seen so far, OCaml also
      supports so-called <emphasis>polymorphic variants</emphasis>. As
      we'll see, polymorphic variants are more flexible and
      syntactically more lightweight than ordinary variants, but that
      extra power comes at a cost.
    </para>
    <para>
      Syntactically, polymorphic variants are distinguished from
      ordinary variants by the leading backtick. And unlike ordinary
      variants, polymorphic variants can be used without an explicit
      type declaration.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let three = `Int 3;;
val three : [&gt; `Int of int ] = `Int 3

[`Int 3; `Float 4.; `Not_a_number]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      As you can see, polymorphic variant types are inferred
      automatically, and when we combine variants with different tags,
      the compiler infers a new type that knows about all of those tags.
      Note that in the above example, the tag name
      (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>, <literal>`Int</literal>) matches the
      type name (<literal>int</literal>). This is a common convention in
      OCaml.
    </para>
    <para>
      The type system will complain, if it sees incompatible uses of the
      same tag:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let five = `Int &quot;five&quot;;;
val five : [&gt; `Int of string ] = `Int &quot;five&quot;
# [three; four; five];;
Characters 14-18:
  [three; four; five];;
                ^^^^
Error: This expression has type [&gt; `Int of string ]
       but an expression was expected of type
         [&gt; `Float of float | `Int of int ]
       Types for tag `Int are incompatible
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>&gt;</literal> at the beginning of the variant types
      above is critical, because it marks the types as being open to
      combination with other variant types. We can read the type
      <literal>[&gt; `Int of string | `Float of float]</literal> as
      describing a variant whose tags include
      <literal>`Int of string</literal> and
      <literal>`Float of float</literal>, but may include more tags as
      well. In other words, you can roughly translate
      <literal>&gt;</literal> to mean: &quot;these tags or more&quot;.
    </para>
    <para>
      OCaml will in some cases infer a variant type with
      <literal>&lt;</literal>, to indicate &quot;these tags or
      less&quot;, as in the following example.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let is_positive = function

val is_positive : [&lt; `Float of float | `Int of int ] -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>&lt;</literal> is there because
      <literal>is_positive</literal> has no way of dealing with values
      that have tags other than <literal>`Float of float</literal> or
      <literal>`Int of int</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can think of these <literal>&lt;</literal> and
      <literal>&gt;</literal> markers as indications of upper and lower
      bounds on the tags involved. If the same set of tags are both an
      upper and a lower bound, we end up with an
      <emphasis>exact</emphasis> polymorphic variant type, which has
      neither marker. For example:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let exact = List.filter ~f:is_positive [three;four];;
val exact : [ `Float of float | `Int of int ] list
   = [`Int 3; `Float 4.]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Perhaps surprisingly, we can also create polymorphic variant types
      that have different upper and lower bounds. Note that
      <literal>Ok</literal> and <literal>Error</literal> in the
      following example come from the <literal>Result.t</literal> type
      from Core.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let is_positive = function
     | `Int   x -&gt; Ok (x &gt; 0)
     | `Float x -&gt; Ok (x &gt; 0.)
     | `Not_a_number -&gt; Error &quot;not a number&quot;;;
val is_positive :
  [&lt; `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number ] -&gt;
  (bool, string) Result.t = &lt;fun&gt;
# List.filter [three; four] ~f:(fun x -&gt;
     match is_positive x with Error _ -&gt; false | Ok b -&gt; b);;
- : [&lt; `Float of float | `Int of int | `Not_a_number &gt; `Float `Int ] list =
[`Int 3; `Float 4.]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Here, the inferred type states that the tags can be no more than
      <literal>`Float</literal>, <literal>`Int</literal> and
      <literal>`Not_a_number</literal>, and must contain at least
      <literal>`Float</literal> and <literal>`Int</literal>. As you can
      already start to see, polymorphic variants can lead to fairly
      complex inferred types.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="example-terminal-colors-redux">
      <title>Example: Terminal colors redux</title>
      <para>
        To see how to use polymorphic variants in practice, we'll return
        to terminal colors. Imagine that we have a new terminal type
        that adds yet more colors, say, by adding an alpha channel so
        you can specify translucent colors. We could model this extended
        set of colors as follows, using an ordinary variant.

        The problem is that <literal>extended_color</literal> and
        <literal>color</literal> are in the compiler's view distinct and

        What we want to do is to share tags between two different

        The key issue with this code is that

        As we saw with the definition of <literal>is_positive</literal>,
        a match statement can lead to the inference of an upper bound on

        Catch-all cases are error-prone even with ordinary variants, but
        they are especially so with polymorphic variants. That's because
        you have no way of bounding what tags your function might have
        to deal with. Such code is particularly vulnerable to typos. For
        instance, if code that uses
        <literal>is_positive_permissive</literal> passes in

        In reality, regular variants are the more pragmatic choice most

      <para>
        Probably the safest and most common use-case for polymorphic
        variants is where ordinary variants would be sufficient, but are
        syntactically too heavyweight. For example, you often want to
        create a variant type for encoding the inputs or outputs to a
        function, where it's not worth declaring a separate type for it.
        Polymorphic variants are very useful here, and as long as there
        are type annotations that constrain these to have explicit,
        exact types, this tends to work well.

      <para>
        Variants are most problematic exactly where you take full
        advantage of their power; in particular, when you take advantage
        of the ability of polymorphic variant types to overlap in the
        tags they support. This ties into OCaml's support for subtyping.
        As we'll discuss further when we cover objects in
        <xref linkend="object-oriented-programming"/>,
        subtyping brings in a lot of complexity, and most of the time,
        that's complexity you want to avoid.

    Nobody likes dealing with errors. It's tedious, it's easy to get
    wrong, and it's usually just not as fun as planning out how your
    program is going to succeed. But error handling is important, and
    however much you don't like thinking about it, having your software
    fail due to poor error handling code is worse.
  </para>
  <para>
    Thankfully, OCaml has powerful tools for handling errors reliably
    and with a minimum of pain. In this chapter we'll discuss some of
    the different approaches in OCaml to handling errors, and give some
    advice on how to design interfaces that make error handling easier.
  </para>
  <para>
    We'll start by describing the two basic approaches for reporting
    errors in OCaml: error-aware return types and exceptions.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="error-aware-return-types">
    <title>Error-aware return types</title>
    <para>
      The best way in OCaml to signal an error is to include that error
      in your return value. Consider the type of the
      <literal>find</literal> function in the <literal>List</literal>
      module.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.find;;
- : 'a list -&gt; f:('a -&gt; bool) -&gt; 'a option
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The option in the return type indicates that the function may not
      succeed in finding a suitable element, as you can see below.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.find [1;2;3] ~f:(fun x -&gt; x &gt;= 2) ;;

- : int option = None
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Having errors be explicit in the return values of your functions
      tells the caller that there is an error that needs to be handled.
      The caller can then handle the error explicitly, either recovering
      from the error or propagating it onward.
    </para>
    <para>
      Consider the <literal>compute_bounds</literal> function defined
      below. The function takes a list and a comparison function, and
      returns upper and lower bounds for the list by finding the
      smallest and largest element on the list.
      <literal>List.hd</literal> and <literal>List.last</literal>, which
      return <literal>None</literal> when they encounter an empty list,
      are used to extract the largest and smallest element of the list.

    <para>
      On the other hand, in <literal>find_mismatches</literal> below,
      errors encountered during the computation do not propagate to the
      return value of the function. <literal>find_mismatches</literal>
      takes two hash tables as arguments, and searches for keys that
      have different data in one table than in the other. As such, the
      failure to find a key in one table isn't a failure of any sort.

      The use of options to encode errors underlines the fact that it's
      not clear whether a particular outcome, like not finding something
      on a list, is an error or is just another valid outcome. This
      depends on the larger context of your program, and thus is not
      something that a general purpose library can know in advance. One
      of the advantages of error-aware return types is that they work
      well in both situations.

        Options aren't always a sufficiently expressive way to report

        Core's answer to this question is the <literal>Error.t</literal>
        type, which tries to forge a good compromise between efficiency,
        convenience, and control over the presentation of errors.
      </para>
      <para>
        It might not be obvious at first why efficiency is an issue at
        all. But generating error messages is an expensive business. An
        ASCII representation of a value can be quite time-consuming to
        construct, particularly if it includes expensive-to-convert
        numerical data.
      </para>
      <para>
        <literal>Error</literal> gets around this issue through
        laziness. In particular, an <literal>Error.t</literal> allows
        you to put off generation of the error string until and unless
        you need it, which means a lot of the time you never have to
        construct it at all. You can of course construct an error
        directly from a string:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Error.of_string &quot;something went wrong&quot;;;
- : Core.Std.Error.t = &quot;something went wrong&quot;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        But you can also construct an <literal>Error.t</literal> from a
        <emphasis>thunk</emphasis>, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, a
        function that takes a single argument of type
        <literal>unit</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Error.of_thunk (fun () -&gt;
    sprintf &quot;something went wrong: %f&quot; 32.3343);;
  - : Core.Std.Error.t = &quot;something went wrong: 32.334300&quot;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In this case, we can benefit from the laziness of
        <literal>Error</literal>, since the thunk won't be called unless
        the <literal>Error.t</literal> is converted to a string.
      </para>
      <para>
        The most common way to create <literal>Error.t</literal>s is
        using <emphasis>s-expressions</emphasis>. An s-expression is a
        balanced parenthetical expression where the leaves of the
        expressions are strings. Thus, the following is a simple
        s-expression:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
(This (is an) (s expression))
</programlisting>
      <para>
        S-expressions are supported by the Sexplib library that is
        distributed with Core, and is the most common serialization
        format used in Core. Indeed, most types in Core come with
        built-in s-expression converters. Here's an example of creating
        an error using the sexp converter for times,
        <literal>Time.sexp_of_t</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Error.create &quot;Something failed a long time ago&quot; Time.epoch Time.sexp_of_t;;
- : Core.Std.Error.t =
&quot;Something failed a long time ago: (1969-12-31 19:00:00.000000)&quot;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Note that the time isn't actually serialized into an
        s-expression until the error is printed out. We're not
        restricted to doing this kind of error reporting with built-in
        types. This will be discussed in more detail in
        <xref linkend="data-serialization-with-s-expressions"/>,
        but Sexplib comes with a language extension that can
        auto-generate sexp-converters for newly generated types, as
        shown below.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let custom_to_sexp = &lt;:sexp_of&lt;float * string list * int&gt;&gt;;;
val custom_to_sexp : float * string list * int -&gt; Sexp.t = &lt;fun&gt;
# custom_to_sexp (3.5, [&quot;a&quot;;&quot;b&quot;;&quot;c&quot;], 6034);;
- : Sexp.t = (3.5 (a b c) 6034)
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We can use this same idiom for generating an error.
      </para>

    &lt;:sexp_of&lt;float * string list * int&gt;&gt; ;;
- : Error.t = Something went terribly wrong: (3.5(a b c)6034)
</programlisting>
      <para>
        <literal>Error</literal> also supports operations for
        transforming errors. For example, it's often useful to augment
        an error with some extra information about the context of the
        error or to combine multiple errors together.
        <literal>Error.tag</literal> and
        <literal>Error.of_list</literal> fulfill these roles, as you can
        see below.
      </para>
      <para>
        The type <literal>'a Or_error.t</literal> is just a shorthand
        for <literal>('a,Error.t) Result.t</literal>, and it is, after
        <literal>option</literal>, the most common way of returning
        errors in Core.

      <title><literal>bind</literal> and other error-handling
      idioms</title>
      <para>
        As you write more error handling code in OCaml, you'll discover
        that certain patterns start to emerge. A number of these common
        patterns have been codified by functions in modules like
        <literal>Option</literal> and <literal>Result</literal>. One
        particularly useful pattern is built around the function
        <literal>bind</literal>, which is both an ordinary function and
        an infix operator <literal>&gt;&gt;=</literal>. Here's the
        definition of <literal>bind</literal> for options.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let bind option f =
    match option with
    | None -&gt; None
    | Some x -&gt; f x
  ;;
val bind : 'a option -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b option) -&gt; 'b option = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        As you can see, <literal>bind None f</literal> returns
        <literal>None</literal> without calling <literal>f</literal>,
        and <literal>bind (Some x) f</literal> returns
        <literal>f x</literal>. Perhaps surprisingly,
        <literal>bind</literal> can be used as a way of sequencing
        together error-producing functions so that the first one to
        produce an error terminates the computation. Here's a rewrite of
        <literal>compute_bounds</literal> to use a nested series of
        <literal>bind</literal>s.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let compute_bounds ~cmp list =
    let sorted = List.sort ~cmp list in
    Option.bind (List.hd sorted) (fun first -&gt;
      Option.bind (List.last sorted) (fun last -&gt;
        Some (first,last)))
  ;;
val compute_bounds : cmp:('a -&gt; 'a -&gt; int) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; ('a * 'a) option =
  &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The above code is a little bit hard to swallow, however, on a
        syntactic level. We can make it easier to read, and drop some of
        the parenthesis, by using the infix operator form of bind, which
        we get access to by locally opening
        <literal>Option.Monad_infix</literal>. The module is called
        <literal>Monad_infix</literal> because the bind operator is part
        of a sub-interface called <literal>Monad</literal>, which we'll
        talk about more in
        <xref linkend="concurrent-programming-with-async"/>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let compute_bounds ~cmp list =
    let open Option.Monad_infix in
    let sorted = List.sort ~cmp list in

      <para>
        This use of <literal>bind</literal> isn't really materially
        better than the one we started with, and indeed, for small
        examples like this, direct matching of options is generally
        better than using <literal>bind</literal>. But for large complex
        examples with many stages of error-handling, the bind idiom
        becomes clearer and easier to manage.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are other useful idioms encoded in the functions in
        <literal>Option</literal>. One example is
        <literal>Option.both</literal>, which takes two optional values
        and produces a new optional pair that is <literal>None</literal>
        if either of its arguments are <literal>None</literal>. Using
        <literal>Option.both</literal>, we can make
        <literal>compute_bounds</literal> even shorter.

        These error-handling functions are valuable because they let you
        express your error handling both explicitly and concisely. We've
        only discussed these functions in the context of the
        <literal>Option</literal> module, but similar functionality is
        available in both <literal>Result</literal> and
        <literal>Or_error</literal>.

    <title>Exceptions</title>
    <para>
      Exceptions in OCaml are not that different from exceptions in many
      other languages, like Java, C# and Python. Exceptions are a way to
      terminate a computation and report an error, while providing a
      mechanism to catch and handle (and possibly recover from)
      exceptions that are triggered by sub-computations.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can trigger an exception by, for example, dividing an integer
      by zero:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# 3 / 0;;
Exception: Division_by_zero.
</programlisting>
    <para>
      And an exception can terminate a computation even if it happens
      nested somewhere deep within it.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map ~f:(fun x -&gt; 100 / x) [1;3;0;4];;
Exception: Division_by_zero.
</programlisting>
    <para>
      If we put a <literal>printf</literal> in the middle of the
      computation, we can see that <literal>List.map</literal> is
      interrupted part way through it's execution, never getting to the
      end of the list.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.map ~f:(fun x -&gt; printf &quot;%d\n%!&quot; x; 100 / x) [1;3;0;4];;
1
3
0
Exception: Division_by_zero.
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In addition to built-in exceptions like
      <literal>Divide_by_zero</literal>, OCaml lets you define your own.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# exception Key_not_found of string;;
exception Key_not_found of string
# raise (Key_not_found &quot;a&quot;);;
Exception: Key_not_found(&quot;a&quot;).
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Here's an example of a function for looking up a key in an
      <emphasis>association list</emphasis>, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis> a
      list of key/value pairs which uses this newly-defined exception:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec find_exn alist key = match alist with
    | [] -&gt; raise (Key_not_found key)
    | (key',data) :: tl -&gt; if key = key' then data else find_exn tl key
  ;;
val find_exn : (string * 'a) list -&gt; string -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
# let alist = [(&quot;a&quot;,1); (&quot;b&quot;,2)];;
val alist : (string * int) list = [(&quot;a&quot;, 1); (&quot;b&quot;, 2)]
# find_exn alist &quot;a&quot;;;
- : int = 1
# find_exn alist &quot;c&quot;;;
Exception: Key_not_found(&quot;c&quot;).
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that we named the function <literal>find_exn</literal> to
      warn the user that the function routinely throws exceptions, a
      convention that is used heavily in Core.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the above example, <literal>raise</literal> throws the
      exception, thus terminating the computation. The type of raise is
      a bit surprising when you first see it:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# raise;;
- : exn -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The return type of <literal>'a</literal> suggests that
      <literal>raise</literal> could return a value of any type. That
      seems impossible, and it is. Really, <literal>raise</literal> has
      this type because it never returns at all. This behavior isn't
      restricted to functions like <literal>raise</literal> that
      terminate by throwing exceptions. Here's another example of a
      function that doesn't return a value.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec forever () = forever ();;
val forever : unit -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>forever</literal> doesn't return a value for a different
      reason: it is an infinite loop.
    </para>
    <para>
      This all matters because it means that the return type of
      <literal>raise</literal> can be whatever it needs to be to fit in
      to the context it is called in. Thus, the type system will let us
      throw an exception anywhere in a program.
    </para>
    <note>
    <title>
    Declaring exceptions with <literal>with sexp</literal>
    </title>
    <para>
      OCaml can't always generate a useful textual representation of an
      exception. For example:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# exception Wrong_date of Date.t;;
exception Wrong_date of Date.t
# Wrong_date (Date.of_string &quot;2011-02-23&quot;);;
- : exn = Wrong_date(_)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      But if we declare the exception using <literal>with sexp</literal>
      (and the constituent types have sexp converters), we'll get
      something with more information.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# exception Wrong_date of Date.t with sexp;;
exception Wrong_date of Core.Std.Date.t
# Wrong_date (Date.of_string &quot;2011-02-23&quot;);;
- : exn = (.Wrong_date 2011-02-23)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The period in front of <literal>Wrong_date</literal> is there
      because the representation generated by
      <literal>with sexp</literal> includes the full module path of the
      module where the exception in question is defined. In this case,
      since we've declared the exception at the toplevel, that module
      path is trivial.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is all part of the support for s-expressions provided by the
      Sexplib library and syntax-extension, which is described in more
      detail in
      <xref linkend="data-serialization-with-s-expressions"/>.
    </para>
    </note>
    <sect2 id="helper-functions-for-throwing-exceptions">
      <title>Helper functions for throwing exceptions</title>
      <para>
        OCaml and Core provide a number of helper functions to simplify
        the task of throwing exceptions. The simplest one is
        <literal>failwith</literal>, which could be defined as follows:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let failwith msg = raise (Failure msg);;
val failwith : string -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        There are several other useful functions for raising exceptions,
        which can be found in the API documentation for the
        <literal>Common</literal> and <literal>Exn</literal> modules in
        Core.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another important way of throwing an exception is the
        <literal>assert</literal> directive. <literal>assert</literal>
        is used for situations where a violation of the condition in
        question indicates a bug. Consider the following piece of code
        for zipping together two lists.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let merge_lists xs ys ~f =
    if List.length xs &lt;&gt; List.length ys then None
    else
      let rec loop xs ys =
        match xs,ys with
        | [],[] -&gt; []
        | x::xs, y::ys -&gt; f x y :: loop xs ys
        | _ -&gt; assert false
      in
      Some (loop xs ys)
   ;;
 val merge_lists : 'a list -&gt; 'b list -&gt; f:('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'c) -&gt; 'c list option =
  &lt;fun&gt;
# merge_lists [1;2;3] [-1;1;2] ~f:(+);;
- : int list option = Some [0; 3; 5]
# merge_lists [1;2;3] [-1;1] ~f:(+);;
- : int list option = None
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Here we use <literal>assert false</literal>, which means that
        the assert is guaranteed to trigger. In general, one can put an
        arbitrary condition in the assertion.
      </para>
      <para>
        In this case, the assert can never be triggered because we have
        a check that makes sure that the lists are of the same length
        before we call <literal>loop</literal>. If we change the code so
        that we drop this test, then we can trigger the assert.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let merge_lists xs ys ~f =
      let rec loop xs ys =
        match xs,ys with

      <para>
        This shows what's special about <literal>assert</literal>, which
        is that it captures the line number and character offset of the
        source location from which the assertion was made.

    <sect2 id="exception-handlers">
      <title>Exception handlers</title>
      <para>
        So far, we've only seen exceptions fully terminate the execution
        of a computation. But often, we want a program to be able to
        respond to and recover from an exception. This is achieved
        through the use of <emphasis>exception handlers</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        In OCaml, an exception handler is declared using a
        <literal>try</literal>/<literal>with</literal> statement. Here's
        the basic syntax.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
try &lt;expr&gt; with
| &lt;pat1&gt; -&gt; &lt;expr1&gt;
| &lt;pat2&gt; -&gt; &lt;expr2&gt;
...
</programlisting>
      <para>
        A <literal>try/with</literal> clause first evaluates its body,
        <literal>&lt;expr&gt;</literal>. If no exception is thrown, then
        the result of evaluating the body is what the entire
        <literal>try/with</literal> clause evaluates to.
      </para>
      <para>
        But if the evaluation of the body throws an exception, then the
        exception will be fed to the pattern match statements following
        the <literal>with</literal>. If the exception matches a pattern,
        then we consider the exception caught, and the
        <literal>try/with</literal> clause evaluates to the expression
        on the right-hand side of the matching pattern.
      </para>
      <para>
        Otherwise, the original exception continues up the stack of
        function calls, to be handled by the next outer exception
        handler. If the exception is never caught, it terminates the
        program.

      <title>Cleaning up in the presence of exceptions</title>
      <para>
        One headache with exceptions is that they can terminate your
        execution at unexpected places, leaving your program in an
        awkward state. Consider the following code snippet:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
let load_config filename =
  let inc = In_channel.create filename in
  let config = Config.t_of_sexp (Sexp.input_sexp inc) in
  In_channel.close inc;
  config
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The problem with this code is that the function that loads the
        s-expression and parses it into a <literal>Config.t</literal>
        might throw an exception if the config file in question is
        malformed. Unfortunately, that means that the
        <literal>In_channel.t</literal> that was opened will never be
        closed, leading to a file-descriptor leak.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can fix this using Core's <literal>protect</literal>
        function. The purpose of <literal>protect</literal> is to ensure
        that the <literal>finally</literal> thunk will be called when
        <literal>f</literal> exits, whether it exits normally or with an
        exception. This is similar to the <literal>try/finally</literal>
        construct available in many programming languages, but it is
        implemented in a library, rather than being a built-in
        primitive. Here's how it could be used to fix
        <literal>load_config</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

      <para>
        OCaml's exception-handling system allows you to tune your
        error-recovery logic to the particular error that was thrown.
        For example, <literal>List.find_exn</literal> throws
        <literal>Not_found</literal> when the element in question
        can'tbe found. You can take advantage of this in your code, for
        example, let's define a function called
        <literal>lookup_weight</literal>, with the following signature.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
val lookup_weight :
  compute_weight:('data -&gt; float) -&gt; ('key * 'data) list -&gt; 'key -&gt; float
</programlisting>
      <para>
        <literal>lookup_weight ~compute_weight alist key</literal>
        should return a floating-point weight by applying
        <literal>compute_weight</literal> to the data associated with
        <literal>key</literal> by <literal>alist</literal>. If
        <literal>key</literal> is not found, then it shoudl return 0.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can implement <literal>lookup_weight</literal> as follows.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let lookup_weight ~compute_weight alist key =
    try
      let data = List.Assoc.find_exn alist key in

      <para>
        Let's think about the behavior of this code in the presence of
        exceptions. In particular, what happens if
        <literal>compute_weight</literal> throws an exception? Ideally,
        <literal>lookup_weight</literal> should propagate that exception
        on, but if the exception happens to be
        <literal>Not_found</literal>, then that's not what will happen:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

- : float = 0.
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This kind of problem is hard to detect in advance, because the
        type system doesn't tell you what exceptions a given function
        might throw. For this reason, it's generally better to avoid
        relying on the identity of the exception to determine the nature
        of a failure. A better approach is to narrow the scope of the
        exception handler, so that when it fires it's very clear what
        part of the code failed.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

        A big part of the point of exceptions is to give useful
        debugging information. But at first glance, OCaml's exceptions
        can be less than informative. Consider the following simple
        program.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

      <para>
        The example in question is short enough that it's quite easy to
        see where the error came from. But in a complex program, simply
        knowing which exception was thrown is usually not enough
        information to figure out what went wrong.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can get more information from OCaml if we turn on stack
        backtraces. A backtrace is essentially a summary of the stack of
        calls that were executed to get to the point where the exception
        was thrown. Backtraces can be enabled by setting the
        <literal>OCAMLRUNPARAM</literal> environment variable as shown.

        You can also capture a backtrace within your program by calling

        Both exceptions and error-aware types are necessary parts of
        programming in OCaml. As such, you often need to move between
        these two worlds. Happily, Core comes with some useful helper
        functions to help you do just that. For example, given a piece
        of code that can throw an exception, you can capture that
        exception into an option as follows:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let find alist key =
    Option.try_with (fun () -&gt; find_exn alist key) ;;

      <para>
        And <literal>Result</literal> and <literal>Or_error</literal>

  <title>Imperative Programming</title>
  <para>
    Most of the code shown so far in this book, and indeed, most OCaml
    code in general, is <emphasis>pure</emphasis>. Pure code works
    without mutating the program's internal state, performing I/O,
    reading the clock, or in any other way interacting with changeable
    parts of the world. Thus, a pure function behaves like a
    mathematical function, always returning the same results when given
    the same inputs, and never affecting the world except insofar as it
    returns the value of its computation.
    <emphasis>Imperative</emphasis> code, on the other hand, operates by
    side-effects that modify a program's internal state or interact with
    the outside world. An imperative function has a new effect, and
    potentially returns different results, every time it's called.
  </para>
  <para>
    Pure code is the default in OCaml, and for good reason --- it's
    generally easier to reason about, less error prone and more
    composable. But imperative code is of fundamental importance to any
    practical programming language because real-world tasks require that
    you interact with the outside world, which is by its nature
    imperative. Imperative programming can also be important for
    performance. While pure code is quite efficient in OCaml, there are
    many algorithms that can only be implemented efficiently using
    imperative techniques.
  </para>
  <para>
    OCaml offers a happy compromise here, making it easy and natural to
    program in a pure style, but also providing great support for
    imperative programming where you need it. This chapter will walk you
    through OCaml's imperative features, and help you use them to their
    fullest.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="example-imperative-dictionaries">
    <title>Example: Imperative dictionaries</title>
    <para>
      We'll start with the implementation of a simple imperative
      dictionary, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, a mutable mapping from keys
      to values. This is really for illustration purposes; both Core and
      the standard library provide imperative dictionaries, and for most
      real world tasks, you should use one of those implementations.
    </para>
    <para>
      Our dictionary, like those in Core and the standard library, will
      be implemented as a hash table. In particular, we'll use an
      <emphasis>open hashing</emphasis> scheme, which is to say the hash
      table will be an array of buckets, each bucket containing a list
      of key/value pairs that have been hashed into that bucket.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's the interface we'll match, provided as an
      <literal>mli</literal>. Here, the type
      <literal>('a, 'b) t</literal> is used for a dictionary with keys
      of type <literal>'a</literal> and data of type
      <literal>'b</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

    <para>
      The <literal>mli</literal> also includes a collection of helper
      functions whose purpose and behavior should be largely inferrable
      from their names and type signatures. Notice that a number of the
      functions, in particular, ones like <literal>add</literal> that
      modify the dictionary, return unit. This is typical of functions
      that act by side-effect.
    </para>
    <para>
      We'll now walk through the implementation (contained in the
      corresponding <literal>ml</literal> file) piece by piece,
      explaining different imperative constructs as they come up.

      Our first step is to define the type of a dictionary as a record

</programlisting>
    <para>
      The first field, <literal>length</literal> is declared as mutable.
      In OCaml, records are immutable by default, but individual fields
      are mutable when marked as such. The second field,
      <literal>buckets</literal>, is immutable, but contains an array,
      which is itself a mutable data structure, as we'll see.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now we'll start putting together the basic functions for
      manipulating a dictionary.

      Note that <literal>num_buckets</literal> is a constant. That's
      because, for simplicity's sake, we're using a fixed-length bucket
      array. For a practical implementation, the length of the array
      would have to be able to grow as the number of elements in the
      dictionary increases.
    </para>
    <para>
      The function <literal>hash_bucket</literal> is used throughout the
      rest of the module to choose the position in the array that a
      given key should be stored at. It is implemented on top of
      <literal>Hashtbl.hash</literal>, which is a hash function provided
      by the OCaml runtime that can be applied to values of any type.
      Thus, its own type is polymorphic:
      <literal>'a -&gt; int</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      While <literal>Hashtbl.hash</literal> can be used with any type,
      it won't necessarily succeed for all values.
      <literal>Hashtbl.hash</literal> will throw an exception if it
      encounters a value it can't handle, like a function or a value
      from a C libraries that lives outside the OCaml heap.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>length</literal> grabs the length from the

      <listitem>
        <para>

        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      Another bit of syntax has popped up in <literal>find</literal>: we
      write <literal>array.(index)</literal> to grab a value from an
      array. Also, <literal>find</literal> uses
      <literal>List.find_map</literal>, which you can see the type of by
      typing it into the toplevel:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.find_map;;
- : 'a list -&gt; f:('a -&gt; 'b option) -&gt; 'b option = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>List.find_map</literal> iterates over the elements of the
      list, calling <literal>f</literal> on each one until a
      <literal>Some</literal> is returned by <literal>f</literal>, at
      which point the value returned by <literal>f</literal> is returned
      by <literal>find_map</literal>. If <literal>f</literal> returns
      <literal>None</literal> on all values, then
      <literal>None</literal> is returned by
      <literal>find_map</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now let's look at the implementation of <literal>iter</literal>:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let iter t ~f =
  for i = 0 to Array.length t.buckets - 1 do
    List.iter t.buckets.(i) ~f:(fun (key, data) -&gt; f ~key ~data)

</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>iter</literal> is designed to walk over all the entries
      in the dictionary. In particular, <literal>iter t ~f</literal>
      will call <literal>f</literal> for each key/value pair in
      dictionary <literal>t</literal>. Note that <literal>f</literal>
      must return <literal>unit</literal>, since it is expected to work
      by side effect rather than by returning a value, and the overall
      <literal>iter</literal> function returns <literal>unit</literal>
      as well.
    </para>
    <para>
      The code for <literal>iter</literal> uses two forms of iteration:
      a <literal>for</literal> loop to walk over the array of buckets;
      and within that loop, and a call to <literal>List.iter</literal>
      to walk over the list of values in a given bucket. We could have
      done the outer loop with a recursive function instead of a
      <literal>for</literal> loop, but <literal>for</literal> loops are
      syntactically convenient, and are more familiar and idiomatic in
      the context of imperative code.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following code is for adding and removing mappings from the
      dictionary.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

  )
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This above code is made more complicated by the fact that we need
      to detect whether we are overwriting or removing an existing
      binding, so we can decide whether <literal>t.length</literal>
      needs to be changed. The helper function
      <literal>bucket_has_key</literal> is used for this purpose.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another piece of syntax shows up in both <literal>add</literal>
      and <literal>remove</literal>: the use of the
      <literal>&lt;-</literal> operator to update elements of an array
      (<literal>array.(i) &lt;- expr</literal>) and for updating a
      record field (<literal>record.field &lt;- expression</literal>).
    </para>
    <para>
      We also use a single semicolon, <literal>;</literal>, as a
      sequencing operator, to allow us to do a sequence of
      side-effecting operations in a row: first, update the bucket, then
      update the count. We could have done this using let bindings:

    let () = t.buckets.(i) &lt;- filtered_bucket in
    t.length &lt;- t.length - 1

    <para>
      When a sequence expression <literal>expr1; expr2</literal> is
      evaluated, <literal>expr1</literal> is evaluated first, and then
      <literal>expr2</literal>. The expression <literal>expr1</literal>
      should have type <literal>unit</literal> (though this is a warning
      rather than a hard restriction), and the value of
      <literal>expr2</literal> is returned as the value of the entire
      sequence. For example, the sequence
      <literal>print_string &quot;hello world&quot;; 1 + 2</literal>
      first prints the string
      <literal>&quot;hello world&quot;</literal>, then returns the
      integer <literal>3</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note also that we do all of the side-effecting operations at the
      very end of each function. This is good practice because it
      minimizes the chance that such operations will be interrupted with
      an exception, leaving the data structure in an inconsistent state.

          The <literal>array</literal> type is used for general purpose
          polymorphic arrays. The <literal>Array</literal> module has a
          variety of utility functions for interacting with arrays,
          including a number of mutating operations. These include
          <literal>Array.set</literal>, for setting an individual

          copying values from one range of indices to another.

          Array literals are written using <literal>[|</literal> and

          Strings are essentially byte-arrays which are often used for
          textual data. The main advantage of using a
          <literal>string</literal> in place of a
          <literal>Char.t array</literal> (a <literal>Char.t</literal>
          is an 8-bit character) is that the former is considerably more
          space efficient; an array uses one word --- 8 bytes on a
          64-bit machine --- to store a single entry, whereas strings
          use one byte per character.

          Strings also come with their own syntax for getting and

          string literals are bounded by quotes. There's also a module

          Variables in OCaml are never mutable --- they can refer to

        Another source of imperative operations in OCaml is resources

      OCaml provides support for traditional imperative looping
      constructs, in particular, <literal>for</literal> and
      <literal>while</literal> loops, even though neither of them is
      strictly necessary. Anything you can do with such a loop you can
      also do with a recursive function, and you can also write
      higher-order functions like <literal>Array.iter</literal> that
      cover much of the same ground.

      Nonetheless, explicit <literal>for</literal> and

      imperative programming and often more concise.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>for</literal> loop is the simpler of the two. Indeed,
      we've already seen the <literal>for</literal> loop in action ---
      the <literal>iter</literal> function in

      navigate the list and give us a point at which to apply mutating

      An <literal>'a element</literal> is a record containing the value

    Cyclic data structures
    </title>
    <para>
      Doubly-linked lists are a cyclic data structure, meaning that it
      is possible to follow a nontrivial sequence of pointers that
      closes in on itself. In general, building cyclic data structures
      requires the use of side-effects. This is done by constructing the
      data elements first, and then adding cycles using assignment
      afterwards.

      fixed-size cyclic data-structures using

        <literal>match</literal> expression is very low, so to separate
        it from the following assignment
        (<literal>t := Some new_elt</literal>) we surround the match
        with <literal>begin ... end</literal>. We could have used
        parenthesis for the same purpose. Without some kind of

        insert the new node, and a value to insert.

        <literal>prev</literal> pointer of the following element, and
        the <literal>next</literal> pointer of the previous element, if
        they exist. If there's no previous element, then the list
        pointer itself is updated. In any case, the next and previous
        pointers of the element itself are set to
        <literal>None</literal>.

      <para>
        These functions are more fragile than they may seem. In
        particular, misuse of the interface may lead to corrupted data.
        For example, double-removing an element will cause the main list
        reference to be set to <literal>None</literal>, thus emptying
        the list. Similar problems arise from removing an element from a
        list it doesn't belong to.

      <para>
        This shouldn't be a big surprise. Complex imperative data
        structures can be quite tricky; considerably trickier than their
        pure equivalents. The issues described above can be dealt with
        by more careful error detection, and such error correction is
        taken care of in modules like Core's
        <literal>Doubly_linked</literal>. You should use imperative data
        structures from a well-designed library when you can. And when
        you can't, you should make sure that the code you write is

      was performed only once, and only after <literal>force</literal>
      had been called.

    <para>
      To better understand how laziness works, let's walk through the
      implementation of our own lazy type. We'll start by declaring
      types to represent a lazy value.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type 'a lazy_state =
  | Delayed of (unit -&gt; 'a)
  | Value of 'a
  | Exn of exn
type 'a lazy_state = Delayed of (unit -&gt; 'a) | Value of 'a | Exn of exn
</programlisting>
    <para>
      A <literal>lazy_state</literal> represents the possible states of
      a lazy value. A lazy value is <literal>Delayed</literal> before it
      has been run, where <literal>Delayed</literal> holds a function
      for computing the value in question. A lazy value is in the
      <literal>Value</literal> state when it has been forced and the
      computation ended normally. The <literal>Exn</literal> case is for
      when the lazy value has been forced, but the computation ended
      with an exception. A lazy value is simply a <literal>ref</literal>
      containing a <literal>lazy_state</literal>, where the
      <literal>ref</literal> makes it possible to change from being in
      the <literal>Delayed</literal> state to being in the
      <literal>Value</literal> or <literal>Exn</literal> states.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can create a lazy value based on a thunk,
      <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, a function that takes a unit argument.
      Wrapping an expression in a thunk is another way to suspend the
      computation of an expression.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let create_lazy f = ref (Delayed f);;
val create_lazy : (unit -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a lazy_state ref = &lt;fun&gt;
# let v = create_lazy
    (fun () -&gt; print_string &quot;performing lazy computation\n&quot;; sqrt 16.);;
  val v : float lazy_state ref = {contents = Delayed &lt;fun&gt;}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Now we just need a way to force a lazy value. The following
      function does just that.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let force v =
    match !v with
    | Value x -&gt; x
    | Exn e -&gt; raise e
    | Delayed f -&gt;
      try
        let x = f () in
        v := Value x;
        x
      with exn -&gt;
        v := Exn exn;
        raise exn
   ;;
val force : 'a lazy_state ref -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Which we can use in the same way we used
      <literal>Lazy.force</literal>:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# force v;;
performing lazy computation
- : float = 4.
# force v;;
- : float = 4.
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The main user-visisble difference between our implementation of
      laziness and the built-in version is syntax. Rather than writing
      <literal>create_lazy (fun () -&gt; sqrt 16.)</literal>, we can
      with the built-in <literal>lazy</literal> just write
      <literal>lazy (sqrt 16.)</literal>.

      <title>Memoization and dynamic programming</title>
      <para>
        Another benign effect is <emphasis>memoization</emphasis>. A
        memoized function remembers the result of previous invocations
        of the function so that they can be returned without further
        computation when the same arguments are presented again.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here's a function that takes as an argument an arbitrary
        single-argument function and returns a memoized version of that
        function. Here we'll use Core's <literal>Hashtbl</literal>
        module, rather than our toy <literal>Dictionary</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let memoize f =
    let table = Hashtbl.Poly.create () in
    (fun x -&gt;

</programlisting>
      <para>
        The code above is a bit tricky. <literal>memoize</literal> takes
        as its argument a function <literal>f</literal>, and then
        allocates a hashtable (called <literal>table</literal>) and
        returns a new function as the memoized version of
        <literal>f</literal>. When called, this new function looks in
        <literal>table</literal> first, and if it fails to find a value,
        calls <literal>f</literal> and stashes the result in
        <literal>table</literal>. Note that <literal>table</literal>
        doesn't go out of scope as long as the function returned by
        <literal>memoize</literal> is in scope.
      </para>
      <para>
        Memoization can be useful whenever you have a function that is
        expensive to recompute, and you don't mind caching old values
        indefinitely. One important caution: every time you create a
        memoized function, there's something of a built-in memory leak.
        As long as you hold on to the memoized function, you're holding
        every result it has returned thus far.
      </para>
      <para>
        Memoization is also useful for efficiently implementing some
        recursive algorithms. One good example is the algorithm for
        computing the <emphasis>edit distance</emphasis> (also called
        the Levenshtein distance) between two strings. The edit distance
        is the number of single-character changes (including letter
        switches, insertions and deletions) required to convert one
        string to the other. This kind of distance metric can be useful
        for a variety of approximate string matching problems, like
        spell checkers.
      </para>
      <para>
        Consider the following code for computing the edit distance.
        Understanding the algorithm isn't important here, but you should
        pay attention to the structure of the recursive calls.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec edit_distance s t =
    match String.length s, String.length t with
    | (0,x) | (x,0) -&gt; x
    | (len_s,len_t) -&gt;
      let s' = String.drop_suffix s 1 in
      let t' = String.drop_suffix t 1 in
      let cost_to_drop_both =
        if s.[len_s - 1] = t.[len_t - 1] then 0 else 1
      in
      List.reduce_exn ~f:Int.min
        [ edit_distance s' t  + 1
        ; edit_distance s  t' + 1
        ; edit_distance s' t' + cost_to_drop_both

# edit_distance &quot;OCaml&quot; &quot;ocaml&quot;;;
- : int = 2
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The thing to note is that if you call
        <literal>edit_distance &quot;OCaml&quot; &quot;ocaml&quot;</literal>,
        then that will in turn dispatch the following calls:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
edit_distance &quot;OCam&quot; &quot;ocaml&quot;
edit_distance &quot;OCaml&quot; &quot;ocam&quot;
edit_distance &quot;OCam&quot; &quot;ocam&quot;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        And these calls will in turn dispatch other calls:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
edit_distance &quot;OCam&quot; &quot;ocaml&quot;
   edit_distance &quot;OCa&quot; &quot;ocaml&quot;

   edit_distance &quot;OCa&quot; &quot;oca&quot;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        As you can see, some of these calls are repeats. For example,
        there are two different calls to
        <literal>edit_distance &quot;OCam&quot; &quot;oca&quot;</literal>.
        The number of redundant calls grows exponentially with the size
        of the strings, meaning that our implementation of
        <literal>edit_distance</literal> is brutally slow for large
        strings. We can see this by writing a small timing function.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let time f =
    let start = Time.now () in
    let x = f () in
    let stop = Time.now () in

    x ;;
val time : (unit -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        And now we can use this to try out some examples.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

      <para>
        Just those few extra characters made it almost four thousand
        times slower!
      </para>
      <para>
        Memoization would be a huge help here, but to fix the problem,
        we need to memoize the calls that
        <literal>edit_distance</literal> makes to itself. This technique
        is sometimes referred to as <emphasis>dynamic
        programming</emphasis>. To see how to do this, let's step away
        from <literal>edit_distance</literal>, and instead consider a
        much simpler example: computing the nth element of the Fibonacci
        sequence. The Fibonacci sequence by definition starts out with
        two <literal>1</literal>'s, with every subsequent element being
        the sum of the previous two. The classic recursive definition of
        Fibonacci is as follows:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec fib i =
    if i &lt;= 1 then 1 else fib (i - 1) + fib (i - 2);;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This is, however, exponentially slow, for the same reason that
        <literal>edit_distance</literal> was slow: we end up making many
        redundant calls to <literal>fib</literal>. It shows up quite
        dramatically in the performance.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# time (fun () -&gt; fib 20);;
Time: 5.17392ms
- : int = 10946
# time (fun () -&gt; fib 40);;
Time: 51.4205s
- : int = 165580141
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Here, <literal>fib 40</literal> takes almost a minute to
        compute, as opposed to five <emphasis>milliseconds</emphasis>
        for <literal>fib 20</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        So, how can we use memoization to make this faster? The tricky
        bit is that we need to insert the memoization before the
        recursive calls within <literal>fib</literal>. We can't just
        define <literal>fib</literal> in the ordinary way and memoize it
        after the fact and expect the first call to
        <literal>fib</literal> to be improved (though of course repeated
        calls will be improved).
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let fib = memoize fib;;
val fib : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# time (fun () -&gt; fib 40);;
Time: 52.6s
- : int = 165580141
# time (fun () -&gt; fib 40);;
Time: 0.00596046ms
- : int = 165580141
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In order to make <literal>fib</literal> fast, our first step
        will be to rewrite <literal>fib</literal> in a way that unwinds
        the recursion. The following version expects as its first
        argument a function (called <literal>fib</literal>) that will be
        called in lieu of the usual recursive call.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let fib_norec fib i =
    if i &lt;= 1 then i
    else fib (i - 1) + fib (i - 2) ;;
val fib_norec : (int -&gt; int) -&gt; int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We can now turn this back into an ordinary Fibonacci function by
        tying the recursive knot, as shown below.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec fib i = fib_norec fib i
val fib : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# fib 5;;
- : int = 8
</programlisting>
      <para>
        We can even write a polymorphic function that we'll call
        <literal>make_rec</literal> that can tie the recursive not for
        any function of this form.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let make_rec f_norec =
    let rec f x = f_norec f x in
    f
  ;;
val make_rec : (('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b = &lt;fun&gt;
# let fib = make_rec fib_norec;;
val fib : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# fib 5;;
- : int = 8
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This is a pretty strange piece of code, and it may take a few
        minutes of thought to figure out what's going on. Like
        <literal>fib_norec</literal>, the function
        <literal>f_norec</literal> passed into
        <literal>make_rec</literal> is a function that isn't recursive,
        but takes as an argument a function that it will call. What
        <literal>make_rec</literal> does is to essentially feed
        <literal>f_norec</literal> to itself, thus making it a true
        recursive function.
      </para>
      <para>
        This is clever enough, but all we've really done is find a new
        way to implement the same old slow Fibonacci function. To make
        it faster, we need variant on <literal>make_rec</literal> that
        inserts memoization when it ties the recursive knot. We'll call
        that function <literal>memo_rec</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let memo_rec f_norec x =
     let fref = ref (fun _ -&gt; assert false) in
     let f = memoize (fun x -&gt; f_norec !fref x) in
     fref := f;
     f x
  ;;
val memo_rec : (('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b = &lt;fun&gt;

      <para>
        Note that <literal>memo_rec</literal> has the same signature as
        <literal>make_rec</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        We're using the reference here as a way of tying the recursive
        knot without using a <literal>let rec</literal>, which for
        reasons we'll describe later wouldn't work here.
      </para>
      <para>
        Using <literal>memo_rec</literal>, we can now build an efficient
        version of <literal>fib</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let fib = memo_rec fib_norec;;
val fib : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# time (fun () -&gt; fib 40);;
Time: 0.236034ms
</programlisting>
      <para>
        And as you can see, the exponential time complexity is now gone.
      </para>
      <para>
        The memory behavior here is important. If you look back at the
        definition of <literal>memo_rec</literal>, you'll see that the
        call to memo_rec does not trigger a call to
        <literal>memoize</literal>. Only when the final argument to
        <literal>fib</literal> is presented does
        <literal>memoize</literal> get called, and the result of that
        call falls out of scope when the <literal>fib</literal> call
        returns. That means that, unlike ordinary memoization, calling
        <literal>memo_rec</literal> on a function does not create a
        memory leak --- the memoization table is collected after the
        computation completes.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can use <literal>memo_rec</literal> as part of a single
        declaration that makes this look like it's little more than a
        special form of <literal>let rec</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let fib = memo_rec (fun fib i -&gt;
    if i &lt;= 1 then 1 else fib (i - 1) + fib (i - 2));;
val fib : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Memoization is overkill for implementing Fibonacci, and indeed,
        the <literal>fib</literal> defined above is not especially
        efficient, allocating space linear in the number passed in to
        <literal>fib</literal>. It's easy enough to write a Fibonacci
        function that takes a constant amount of space.
      </para>
      <para>
        But memoization is a good approach for optimizing
        <literal>edit_distance</literal>, and we can apply the same
        approach we used on <literal>fib</literal> here. We will need to
        change <literal>edit_distance</literal> to take a pair of
        strings as a single argument, since <literal>memo_rec</literal>
        only works on single-argument functions. (We can always recover
        the original interface with a wrapper function.) With just that
        change and the addition of the <literal>memo_rec</literal> call,
        we can get a memoized version of
        <literal>edit_distance</literal>:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let edit_distance = memo_rec (fun edit_distance (s,t) -&gt;

    | (len_s,len_t) -&gt;
      let s' = String.drop_suffix s 1 in

        This new version of <literal>edit_distance</literal> is much

        we did for <literal>make_rec</literal> earlier. Here's code that
        tries to do just that:

Error: This kind of expression is not allowed as right-hand side of `let rec'
</programlisting>
      <para>
        OCaml rejects the definition because OCaml, as a strict
        language, has limits on what it can put on the right hand side
        of a <literal>let rec</literal>. In particular, imagine how the
        following code snippet would be compiled.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

      <para>
        Note that <literal>x</literal> is an ordinary value, not a
        function. As such, it's not clear how to execute this code. In
        some sense, you could imagine it compiling down to an infinite
        loop, but there's no looping control structure to make that
        happen.
      </para>
      <para>
        To avoid such cases, the compiler only allows three possible
        constructs to show up on the right-hand side of a
        <literal>let rec</literal>: a function definition, a
        constructor, or the lazy keyword. This excludes some reasonable
        things, like our definition of <literal>memo_rec</literal>, but
        it also blocks things that don't make sense, like our definition
        of <literal>x</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        It's worth noting that these restrictions don't show up in a
        lazy language like Haskell. Indeed, we can make something like
        our definition of <literal>x</literal> work if we use OCaml's
        laziness:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec x = lazy (Lazy.force x + 1);;
val x : int lazy_t = &lt;lazy&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Of course, actually trying to compute this will fail. OCaml's
        <literal>lazy</literal> throws an exception when a lazy value
        tries to force itself as part of its own evaluation.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Lazy.force x;;
Exception: Lazy.Undefined.
</programlisting>
      <para>
        But we can also create useful recursive definitions with
        <literal>lazy</literal>. In particular, we can use laziness to
        make our definition of <literal>memo_rec</literal> work without
        explicit mutation.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let lazy_memo_rec f_norec x =
     let rec f = lazy (memoize (fun x -&gt; f_norec (Lazy.force f) x)) in
     (Lazy.force f) x
  ;;
val lazy_memo_rec : (('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b = &lt;fun&gt;
# time (fun () -&gt; lazy_memo_rec fib_norec 40);;
Time: 0.298977ms
- : int = 102334155
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Laziness is more constrained than explicit mutation, and so in
        some cases can lead to code whose behavior is easier to think
        about.

      Imperative programming is about more than modifying in-memory
      data-structures. Any function that doesn't boil down to a
      deterministic transformation from its arguments to its return
      value is imperative in nature. That includes not only things that
      mutate your program's data, but also operations that interact with
      the world outside of your program. An important example of this
      kind of interaction is I/O, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, operations
      for reading or writing data to things like files, terminal input
      and output, and network sockets.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are multiple I/O libraries in OCaml. In this section we'll
      discuss OCaml's buffered I/O library that can be used through the
      <literal>In_channel</literal> and <literal>Out_channel</literal>
      modules in Core. Other I/O primitives are also available through
      the <literal>Unix</literal> module in Core as well as
      <literal>Async</literal>, the asynchronous I/O library that is
      covered in
      <xref linkend="concurrent-programming-with-async"/>.
      Most of the functionality in Core's <literal>In_channel</literal>,
      <literal>Out_channel</literal> (and in Core's
      <literal>Unix</literal> module) derives from the standard library,
      but we'll use Core's interfaces here.

    <sect2 id="terminal-io">
      <title>Terminal I/O</title>
      <para>
        OCaml's buffered I/O library is organized around two types:
        <literal>in_channel</literal>, for channels you read from, and
        <literal>out_channel</literal>, for channels you write to.
        <literal>In_channel</literal> and <literal>Out_channel</literal>
        modules only have direct support for channels corresponding to
        files and terminals; other kinds of channels can be created
        through the <literal>Unix</literal> module.
      </para>
      <para>
        We'll start our discussion of I/O by focusing on the terminal.
        Following the UNIX model, communication with the terminal is
        organized around three channels, which correspond to the three
        standard file descriptors in Unix:

            terminal, which handles keyboard input.

            <literal>stdout</literal> appears on the user terminal.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            <literal>Out_channel.stderr</literal>. The &quot;standard

            <literal>stdout</literal>, but is intended for error
            messages.

        The values <literal>stdin</literal>, <literal>stdout</literal>

        Let's see this in action in a simple interactive application.
        The following program, <literal>time_converter</literal>,
        prompts the user for a timezone, and then prints out the current
        time in that timezone. Here, we use Core's
        <literal>Zone</literal> module for looking up a timezone, and
        the <literal>Time</literal> module for computing the current
        time and printing it out in the timezone in question.

        We called <literal>Out_channel.flush</literal> on
        <literal>stdout</literal> because
        <literal>out_channel</literal>s are buffered, which is to say
        that OCaml doesn't immediately do a write every time you call
        <literal>output_string</literal>. Instead, writes are buffered
        until either enough has been written to trigger the flushing of
        the buffers, or until a flush is explicitly requested. This
        greatly increases the efficiency of the writing process, by
        reducing the number of system calls.

        Note that <literal>In_channel.input_line</literal> returns a

        (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, an end-of-file condition).
        <literal>Out_channel.output_string</literal> is used to print
        the final output, and <literal>Out_channel.flush</literal> is
        called to flush that output to the screen. The final flush is
        not technically required, since the program ends after that

        anyway, but the flush is nonetheless good practice.

      <para>
        Generating output with functions like
        <literal>Out_channel.output_string</literal> is simple and easy
        to understand, but can be a bit verbose. OCaml also supports
        formatted output using the <literal>printf</literal> function,
        which is modeled after <literal>printf</literal> in the C
        standard library. <literal>printf</literal> takes a
        <emphasis>format string</emphasis> that describe what to print
        and how to format it, as well as arguments to be printed, as
        determined by the formatting directives embedded in the format
        string. So, for example, we can write:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# printf &quot;%i is an integer, %F is a float, \&quot;%s\&quot; is a string\n&quot;
    3 4.5 &quot;five&quot;;;
3 is an integer, 4.5 is a float, &quot;five&quot; is a string
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Importantly, and unlike C's <literal>printf</literal>, the
        <literal>printf</literal> in OCaml is type-safe. In particular,
        if we provide an argument whose type doesn't match what's
        presented in the format string, we'll get a type error.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

      Understanding format strings
      </title>
      <para>
        The format strings used by <literal>printf</literal> turn out to
        be quite different from ordinary strings. This difference ties
        to the fact that OCaml format strings, unlike their equivalent
        in C, are type-safe. In particular, the compiler checks that the
        types referred to by the format string match the types of the
        rest of the arguments passed to <literal>printf</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        To check this, OCaml needs to analyze the contents of the format
        string at compile time, which means the format string needs to
        be available as a string literal at compile time. Indeed, if you
        try to pass an ordinary string to <literal>printf</literal>, the
        compiler will complain.

      <para>
        If OCaml infers that a given string literal is a format string,
        then it parses it at compile time as such, choosing its type in
        accordance with the formatting directives it finds. Thus, if we
        add a type-annotation indicating that the string we're defining
        is actually a format string, it will be interpreted as such:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let fmt : ('a, 'b, 'c) format =
    &quot;%i is an integer, %F is a float, \&quot;%s\&quot; is a string\n&quot;;;

</programlisting>
      <para>
        And accordingly, we can pass it to <literal>printf</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

        If this looks different from everything else you've seen so far,
        that's because it is. This is really a special case in the
        type-system. Most of the time, you don't need to worry about
        this special handling of format strings --- you can just use
        <literal>printf</literal> and not worry about the details. But
        it's useful to keep the broad outlines of the story in the back
        of your head.

        Another common use of <literal>in_channel</literal>s and
        <literal>out_channel</literal>s is for working with files.
        Here's a couple of functions, one that creates a file full of
        numbers, and the other that reads in such a file and returns the
        sum of those numbers.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let create_number_file filename numbers =
    let outc = Out_channel.create filename in
    List.iter numbers ~f:(fun x -&gt; fprintf outc &quot;%d\n&quot; x);
    Out_channel.close outc
  ;;
 val create_number_file : string -&gt; int Core.Std.List.t -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;
# let sum_file filename =
     let file = In_channel.create filename in
     let numbers = List.map ~f:Int.of_string (In_channel.input_lines file) in
     let sum = List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) numbers in
     In_channel.close file;
     sum

val sum_file : string -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# create_number_file &quot;numbers.txt&quot; [1;2;3;4;5];;
- : unit = ()
# sum_file &quot;numbers.txt&quot;;;
- : int = 15
</programlisting>
      <para>
        For both of these functions we followed the same basic sequence:
        we first create the channel, then use the channel, and finally
        close the channel. The closing of the channel is important,
        since without it, we won't release resources associated with the
        file back to the operating system.
      </para>
      <para>
        One problem with the code above is that if it throws an
        exception in the middle of its work, it won't actually close the
        file. If we try to read a file that doesn't actually contain
        numbers, we'll see such an error:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# sum_file &quot;/etc/hosts&quot;;;
Exception: (Failure &quot;Int.of_string: \&quot;##\&quot;&quot;).
</programlisting>
      <para>
        And if we do this over and over in a loop, we'll eventually run
        out of file descriptors.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# for i = 1 to 10000 do try ignore (sum_file &quot;/etc/hosts&quot;) with _ -&gt; () done;;

Exception: (Sys_error &quot;numbers.txt: Too many open files&quot;).

      <para>
        And now, you'll need to restart your toplevel if you want to
        open any more files!
      </para>
      <para>
        To avoid this, we need to make sure that our code cleans up
        after itself. We can do this using the
        <literal>protect</literal> function described in
        <xref linkend="error-handling"/>, as follows.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

        And now, the file descriptor leak is gone:

</programlisting>
      <para>
        This is really an example of a more general complexity of
        imperative programming. When programming imperatively, you need
        to be quite careful to make sure that exceptions don't leave you
        in an awkward state.
      </para>
      <para>
        <literal>In_channel</literal> also supports some idioms that
        handle some of the details of this for you. For example, the
        <literal>with_file</literal> function takes a filename and a
        function for processing that file, and takes care of the opening
        and closing of the file transparently.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let sum_file filename =
     In_channel.with_file filename ~f:(fun file -&gt;

      <para>
        Another misfeature of our implementation of
        <literal>sum_file</literal> is that we read the entire file into
        memory before processing it. For a large file, it's more
        efficient to process a line at a time. You can use the
        <literal>In_channel.fold_lines</literal> function to do just
        that.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let sum_file filename =
     In_channel.with_file filename ~f:(fun file -&gt;

    <title>Order of evaluation</title>
    <para>
      The order in which expressions are evaluated is an important part
      of the definition of a programming language, and it is
      particularly important when programming imperatively. Most
      programming languages you're likely to have encountered are
      <emphasis>strict</emphasis>, and OCaml is too. In a strict
      language, when you bind an identifier to the result of some
      expression, the expression is evaluated before the variable is
      defined. Similarly, if you call a function on a set of arguments,
      those arguments are evaluated before they are passed to the
      function.

      Consider the following simple example. Here, we have a collection

    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let x = sin 120. in

      In some sense, we don't really need to compute the

      <literal>sin 128</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      It doesn't have to be this way. Using the <literal>lazy</literal>

      OCaml is strict by default for a good reason: Lazy evaluation and
      imperative programming generally don't mix well, because laziness
      makes it harder to reason about when a given side effect is going
      to occur. Understanding the order of side-effects is essential to
      reasoning about the behavior of an imperative program.
    </para>
    <para>
      In a strict language, we know that expressions that are bound by a
      sequence of let-bindings will be evaluated in the order that
      they're defined. But what about the evaluation order within a
      single expression? Officially, the answer is that evaluation order
      within an expression is undefined. In practice, OCaml has only one
      compiler, and that behavior is a kind of <emphasis>de
      facto</emphasis> standard. Unfortunately, the evaluation order in
      this case is often the oppose of what one might expect.

      <literal>remember</literal> simply caches the first value that's
      passed to it, returning that value on every call. Note that we've
      carefully written <literal>remember</literal> so that
      <literal>cache</literal> is created and initialized once, and is
      shared across invocations of <literal>remember</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>remember</literal> is not a terribly useful function, but
      it raises an interesting question: what type should it have?
    </para>
    <para>
      On its first call, <literal>remember</literal> returns the same
      value its passed, which means its input type and return type
      should match. Accordingly, <literal>remember</literal> should have
      the type <literal>t -&gt; t</literal> for some type
      <literal>t</literal>. There's nothing about
      <literal>remember</literal> that ties the choice of
      <literal>t</literal> to any particular type, so you might expect
      OCaml to generalize, replacing <literal>t</literal> with a
      polymorphic type variable. It's this kind of generalization that
      gives us polymorphic types in the first place. The identity
      function, as an example, gets a polymorphic type in this way.
    </para>

      different types.

    <para>
      This is not what happens with <literal>remember</literal>, though.
      Here's the type that OCaml infers for remember, which looks
      almost, but not quite, like the type of the identity function.

val remember : '_a -&gt; '_a = &lt;fun&gt;

    <para>
      The underscore in the type variable <literal>'_a</literal> tells
      us that the variable is only <emphasis>weakly

      any <emphasis>single</emphasis> type. That makes sense, because,
      unlike <literal>identity</literal>, <literal>remember</literal>
      always returns the value it was passed on its first invocation,
      which means it can only be used with one type.
    </para>
    <para>
      OCaml will convert a weakly polymorphic variable to a concrete

    <sect2 id="the-value-restriction">
      <title>The Value Restriction</title>
      <para>
        So, when does the compiler infer weakly polymorphic types? As
        we've seen, we need weakly polymorphic types when a value of
        unknown type is stored in a persistent mutable cell. Because the
        type-system isn't precise enough to determine all cases where
        this might happen, OCaml uses a rough rule to flag cases where
        it's sure there are no persistent refs, and to only infer
        polymorphic types in those cases. This rule is called
        <emphasis>the value restriction</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The core of the value restriction is the observation that some
        kinds of simple values by their nature can't contain refs,
        including:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Constants (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, things like integer
            and floating point literals)
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Constructors that contain only other simple values
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Function declarations, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>,
            expressions that begin with <literal>fun</literal> or
            <literal>function</literal>, or, the equivalent let binding,
            <literal>let f x = ...</literal>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <literal>let</literal> bindings of the form
            <literal>let var = &lt;expr1&gt; in &lt;expr2&gt;</literal>,
            where both <literal>&lt;expr1&gt;</literal> and
            <literal>&lt;expr2&gt;</literal> are simple values.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        Thus, the following expression is a simple value, and as a
        result, the types of values contained within it are allowed to
        be polymorphic.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# (fun x -&gt; [x;x]);;
- : 'a -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        But, if we write down an expression that isn't a simple value by
        the above definition, we'll get different results. For example,
        consider what happens if we try to memoize the function defined
        above.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# memoize (fun x -&gt; [x;x]);;
- : '_a -&gt; '_a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The memoized version of the function does in fact need to be
        restricted to a single type, because it uses mutable state
        behind the scenes to cache previous invocations of the function
        it has passed. But OCaml would make the same determination even
        if the function in question did no such thing. Consider this
        example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# identity (fun x -&gt; [x;x]);;
- : '_a -&gt; '_a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        It would be safe to infer a weakly polymorphic variable here,
        but because OCaml's type system doesn't distinguish between pure
        and impure functions, it can't separate those two cases.
      </para>
      <para>
        The value restriction doesn't require that there is no mutable
        state, only that there is no <emphasis>persistent</emphasis>
        mutable state that could share values between uses of the same
        function. Thus, a function that produces a fresh reference every
        time it's called can have a fully polymorphic type:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let f () = ref None;;
val f : unit -&gt; 'a option ref = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        But a function that has a mutable cache that persists across
        calls, like memoize, can only be weakly polymorphic.

      <title>Partial application and the value restriction</title>
      <para>
        Most of the time, when the value restriction kicks in, it's for
        a good reason, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, it's because the value
        in question can actually only safely be used with a single type.
        But sometimes, the value restriction kicks in when you don't
        want it. The most common such case is partially applied
        functions. A partially applied function, like any function
        application, is not a simple value, and as such, functions
        created by partial application are sometimes less general than
        you might expect.
      </para>
      <para>
        Consider the <literal>List.init</literal> function, which is
        used for creating lists where each element is created by calling
        a function on the index of that element.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

</programlisting>
      <para>
        Imagine we wanted to create a specialized version of
        <literal>List.init</literal> that always created lists of length
        10. We could do that using partial application, as follows.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let list_init_10 = List.init 10;;
val list_init_10 : f:(int -&gt; '_a) -&gt; '_a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        As you can see, we now infer a weakly polymorphic type for the
        resulting function, and for good reason. There's nothing that
        tells us that <literal>List.init</literal> isn't creating a
        persistent <literal>ref</literal> somewhere inside of it that
        would be shared across multiple calls to
        <literal>list_init_10</literal>. We can eliminate this
        possibility, and at the same time get the compiler to infer a
        polymorphic type, by using explicit variables rather than
        partial application.

      <title>Relaxing the value restriction</title>
      <para>
        OCaml is actually a little better at inferring polymorphic types
        than is implied above. The value restriction as we described it
        above is basically a syntactic check: there are a few operations
        that you can do that count as simple values, and anything that's
        a simple value can be generalized.
      </para>
      <para>
        But OCaml actually has a relaxed version of the value
        restriction that can make some use of type information to allow
        polymorphic types for things that are not simple values.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, we saw above that a function application, even a
        simple application of the identity function, is not a simple
        value and thus can turn a polymorphic value into a weakly
        polymorphic one.
      </para>

# identity (fun x -&gt; [x;x]);;
- : '_a -&gt; '_a list = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        But that's not always the case. When the type of the returned
        value is immutable, then OCaml can typically infer a fully
        polymorphic type.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# identity [];;
- : 'a list = []
</programlisting>
      <para>
        On the other hand, if the returned type is potentially mutable,
        then the result will be weakly polymorphic.

        A more important example of this comes up when defining abstract
        data types. Consider the following simple data-structure for an
        immutable list type that supports constant-time concatenation.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

  end
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The details of the implementation don't matter so much, but it's
        important to note that a <literal>Concat_list.t</literal> is
        unquestionably an immutable value. However, when it comes to the
        value restriction, OCaml treats it as if it were mutable.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Concat_list.empty;;
- : 'a Concat_list.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# identity Concat_list.empty;;

</programlisting>
      <para>
        The issue here is that the signature, by virtue of being
        abstract, has obscured the fact that
        <literal>Concat_list.t</literal> is in fact an immutable
        data-type. We can resolve this in one of two ways: either by
        making the type concrete (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, exposing
        the implementation in the <literal>mli</literal>), which is
        often not desirable; or by marking the type variable in question
        as <emphasis>covariant</emphasis>. We'll learn more about
        variance and covariance in
        <xref linkend="object-oriented-programming"/>, but for
        now, you can think of it as an annotation which can be put in
        the interface of a pure data structure.
      </para>
      <para>
        Thus, if we replace <literal>type 'a t</literal> in the
        interface with <literal>type +'a t</literal>, that will make it
        explicit in the interface that the data-structure doesn't
        contain any persistent references to values of type
        <literal>'a</literal>, at which point, OCaml can infer
        polymorphic types for expressions of this type that are not
        simple values.

      containing a single integer variable <literal>x</literal>, and
      returns a new module with <literal>x</literal> incremented by one.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module type X_int = sig val x : int end;;
module type X_int = sig val x : int end
# module Increment (M:X_int) : X_int = struct
    let x = M.x + 1
  end;;
module Increment : functor (M : X_int) -&gt; X_int
</programlisting>
    <para>
      One thing that immediately jumps out about functors is that
      they're considerably more heavyweight syntactically than ordinary
      functions. For one thing, functors require explicit (module) type
      annotations, which ordinary functions do not. Here, we've
      specified the module type <literal>X_int</literal> for both the
      input and output of the functor. Technically, only the type on the
      input is mandatory, although in practice, one often specifies
      both.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following shows what happens when we omit the module type for
      the output of the functor.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Increment (M:X_int) = struct
    let x = M.x + 1
  end;;
module Increment : functor (M : X_int) -&gt; sig val x : int end
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can see that the inferred module type of the output is now
      written out explicitly, rather than being a reference to the named
      signature <literal>X_int</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can now use <literal>Increment</literal> to define new modules.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Three = struct let x = 3 end;;
  module Three : sig val x : int end
# module Four = Increment(Three);;
module Four : sig val x : int end
# Four.x - Three.x;;
- : int = 1
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In this case, we applied <literal>Increment</literal> to a module
      whose signature is exactly equal to <literal>X_int</literal>. But
      we can apply <literal>Increment</literal> to any module that
      satisfies the interface <literal>X_int</literal>, in the same way
      that a the contents of an <literal>ml</literal> file can satisfy
      the <literal>mli</literal>. That means that the module type can
      omit some information available in the module, either by dropping
      fields or by leaving some fields abstract. Here's an example:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Three_and_more = struct
    let x = 3
    let y = &quot;three&quot;
  end;;
module Three_and_more : sig val x : int val x_string : string end
# module Four = Increment(Three_and_more);;
module Four : sig val x : int end
</programlisting>

  <sect1 id="a-bigger-example-computing-with-intervals">
    <title>A bigger example: computing with intervals</title>
    <para>
      Let's now consider a more realistic example of how to use
      functors: a library for computing with intervals. This library
      will be functorized over the type of the endpoints of the
      intervals and the ordering of those endpoints.
    </para>
    <para>
      First we'll define a module type that captures the information
      we'll need about the endpoint type. This interface, which we'll
      call <literal>Comparable</literal>, contains just two things: a
      comparison function, and the type of the values to be compared.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module type Comparable = sig
    type t
    val compare : t -&gt; t -&gt; int
  end ;;
module type Comparable = sig type t val compare : t -&gt; t -&gt; int end
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The comparison function follows the standard OCaml idiom for such
      functions, returning <literal>0</literal> if the two elements are
      equal, a positive number if the first element is larger than the
      second, and a negative number if the first element is smaller than
      the second. Thus, we could rewrite the standard comparison
      functions on top of <literal>compare</literal> as shown below.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
compare x y &lt; 0     (* x &lt; y *)
compare x y = 0     (* x = y *)
compare x y &gt; 0     (* x &gt; y *)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The functor for creating the interval module is shown below. We
      represent an interval with a variant type, which is either
      <literal>Empty</literal> or <literal>Interval (x,y)</literal>,
      where <literal>x</literal> and <literal>y</literal> are the bounds
      of the interval.

    <para>
      We can instantiate the functor by applying it to a module with the
      right signature. In the following, we provide the functor input as
      an anonymous module.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Int_interval =
    Make_interval(struct
      type t = int

</programlisting>
    <para>
      When we choose our interfaces that are aligned with the standards
      of our libraries, we don't need to construct a custom module to
      feed to the functor. In this case, for example, we can directly
      use the <literal>Int</literal> or <literal>String</literal>
      modules provided by Core.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Int_interval = Make_interval(Int) ;;
# module String_interval = Make_interval(String) ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This works because many modules in Core, including
      <literal>Int</literal> and <literal>String</literal>, satisfy an
      extended version of the <literal>Comparable</literal> signature
      described above. Standardized signatures are generally good
      practice, both because they makes functors easier to use, and
      because they make the codebase generally easier to navigate.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now we can use the newly defined <literal>Int_interval</literal>
      module like any ordinary module.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let i1 = Int_interval.create 3 8;;
val i1 : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Interval (3, 8)
# let i2 = Int_interval.create 4 10;;
val i2 : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Interval (4, 10)
# Int_interval.intersect i1 i2;;
- : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Interval (4, 8)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This design gives us the freedom to use any comparison function we
      want for comparing the endpoints. We could, for example, create a
      type of int interval with the order of the comparison reversed, as
      follows:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Rev_int_interval =
    Make_interval(struct
      type t = int
      let compare x y = Int.compare y x
    end);;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The behavior of <literal>Rev_int_interval</literal> is of course
      different from <literal>Int_interval</literal>, as we can see
      below.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let interval = Int_interval.create 4 3;;
val interval : Int_interval.t = Int_interval.Empty
# let rev_interval = Rev_int_interval.create 4 3;;
val rev_interval : Rev_int_interval.t = Rev_int_interval.Interval (4, 3)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Importantly, <literal>Rev_int_interval.t</literal> is a different
      type than <literal>Int_interval.t</literal>, even though its
      physical representation is the same. Indeed, the type system will
      prevent us from confusing them.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

      This is important, because confusing the two kinds of intervals
      would be a semantic error, and it's an easy one to make. The

      up a lot.

        To fix this, we need to expose the fact that

        way of doing this is through a <emphasis>sharing

        The syntax for a sharing constraint on a module type is as

        signature that's been modified so that it exposes the fact that
        <literal>s</literal> is equal to <literal>t</literal>. We can

      Another common use of functors is to generate type-specific
      functionality for a given module in a standardized way. Let's see
      how this works in the context of a functional queue, which is just
      a functional version of a FIFO (first-in, first-out) queue. Being
      functional, operations on the queue return new queues, rather than
      modifying the queues that were passed in.

      Now let's implement <literal>Fqueue</literal>. A standard trick is
      for the <literal>Fqueue</literal> to maintain an input and an

      <literal>enqueue</literal> on the first list, and can efficiently
      dequeue from the out list. If you attempt to dequeue when the
      output list is empty, the input list is reversed and becomes the

      One problem with our <literal>Fqueue</literal> is that the
      interface is quite skeletal. There are lots of useful helper
      functions that one might want that aren't there. For example, for
      lists we have <literal>List.iter</literal> which runs a function
      on each node; and a <literal>List.find</literal> that finds the
      first element on the list that matches a given predicate. Such
      helper functions come up for pretty much every container type, and
      implementing them over and over is a bit of a dull and repetitive
      affair.
    </para>
    <para>
      As it happens, many of these helper functions can be derived
      mechanically from just the fold function we already implemented.
      Rather than write all of these helper functions by hand for every
      new container type, we can instead use a functor that will let us
      add this functionality to any container that has a
      <literal>fold</literal> function.

    <para>

      fold-supporting container. As you can see,
      <literal>Foldable</literal> contains a module signature
      <literal>S</literal> which defines the signature that is required

  <title>Object Oriented Programming</title>
  <para>
    We've already seen several tools that OCaml provides for organizing
    programs, particularly first-class modules. In addition, OCaml also
    supports object-oriented programming. There are objects, classes,
    and their associated types. Objects are good for encapsulation and
    abstraction, and classes are good for code re-use.
  </para>

  <title>
  What is Object-Oriented Programming?
  </title>
  <para>
    Object-oriented programming (often shorted to OOP) is a programming
    style that encapsulates computation and data within logical
    <emphasis>objects</emphasis>. Each object contains some data stored
    in <emphasis>fields</emphasis>, and has <emphasis>method</emphasis>
    functions that can be invoked against the data within the object.
    The code definition behind an object is called a
    <emphasis>class</emphasis>, and objects are constructed from a class
    definition by calling a constructor with the data that the object
    will use to build itself.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are four fundamental properties that differentiate OOP from
    other styles:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Abstraction</emphasis>: the details of the
        implementation are hidden in the object, and the external
        interface is just the set of publically-accessible methods.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Dynamic lookup</emphasis>: when a message is sent to
        an object, the method to be executed is determined by the
        implementation of the object, not by some static property of the
        program. In other words, different objects may react to the same
        message in different ways.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Subtyping</emphasis>: if an object
        <literal>a</literal> has all the functionality of an object
        <literal>b</literal>, then we may use <literal>a</literal> in
        any context where <literal>b</literal> is expected.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Inheritance</emphasis>: the definition of one kind of
        object can be re-used to produce a new kind of object. This new

        its parent.

  <sect1 id="when-to-use-objects">
    <title>When to use objects</title>
    <para>
      You might wonder when to use objects in OCaml, which has a
      multitude of alternative mechanisms to express the same concept.
      First-class modules are more expressive (a module can include
      types, while classes and objects cannot). Modules, functors, and
      algebraic data types also offer a wide range of ways to express
      program structure. In fact, many seasoned OCaml programmers rarely
      use classes and objects, if at all.
    </para>
    <para>
      Modules already provide these features in some form, but the main
      focus of classes is on code re-use through inheritance and late
      binding of methods. This is a critical property of classes: the
      methods that implement an object are determined when the object is
      instantiated, a form of <emphasis>dynamic</emphasis> binding. In
      the meantime, while classes are being defined, it is possible (and
      necessary) to refer to methods without knowing statically how they
      will be implemented.
    </para>
    <para>
      In contrast, modules use static (lexical) scoping. If you want to
      parameterize your module code so that some part of it can be
      implemented later, you would write a function or functor. This is
      more explicit, but often more verbose than overriding a method in
      a class.
    </para>
    <para>
      In general, a rule of thumb is: use classes and objects in
      situations where dynamic binding is a big win, for example if you
      have many similar variations in the implementation of a concept.
      Two good examples are Xavier Leroy's
      <ulink url="http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/software.html#cryptokit">Cryptokit</ulink>,
      which provides a variety of cryptographic primitives that can be
      combined in building-block style, and the
      <ulink url="http://cristal.inria.fr/camlimages/">Camlimages</ulink>
      library which manipulates various graphical file formats.
    </para>
    <para>
      In this chapter, we'll introduce you to the basics of object
      definition and use in OCaml, and then demonstrate their use with
      an example using Cryptokit. We'll return to the more advanced
      areas of object use later on in the book in
      <xref linkend="object-subtyping-and-inheritance"/>.

  <sect1 id="ocaml-objects">
    <title>OCaml objects</title>
    <para>
      If you already know about object oriented programming in a
      language like Java or C++, the OCaml object system may come as a
      surprise. Foremost is the complete separation of subtyping and
      inheritance in OCaml. In a language like Java, a class name is
      also used as the type of objects created by instantiating it, and
      the subtyping rule corresponds to inheritance. For example, if we
      implement a class <literal>Stack</literal> in Java by inheriting
      from a class <literal>Deque</literal>, we would be allowed to pass
      a stack anywhere a deque is expected (this is a silly example of
      course, practitioners will point out that we shouldn't do it).
    </para>
    <para>
      OCaml is entirely different. Classes are used to construct objects
      and support inheritance, including non-subtyping inheritance.
      Classes are not types. Instead, objects have <emphasis>object
      types</emphasis>, and if you want to use objects, you aren't
      required to use classes at all. Here's an example of a simple
      object.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let p =
  object
    val mutable x = 0
    method get = x
    method set i = x &lt;- i
  end;;
val p : &lt; get : int; set : int -&gt; unit &gt; = &lt;obj&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The object has an integer value <literal>x</literal>, a method
      <literal>get</literal> that returns x, and a method
      <literal>set</literal> that updates the value of
      <literal>x</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The object type is enclosed in angle brackets
      <literal>&lt; ... &gt;</literal>, containing just the types of the
      methods. Fields, like <literal>x</literal>, are not part of the
      public interface of an object. All interaction with an object is
      through its methods. The syntax for a method invocation (also
      called &quot;sending a message&quot; to the object) uses the
      <literal>#</literal> character.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# p#get;
- : int = 0
# p#set 17;;
- : unit = ()
# p#get;;
- : int = 17
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Objects can also be constructed by functions. If we want to
      specify the initial value of the object, we can define a function
      that takes the value and returns an object.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let make i =
  object
    val mutable x = i
    method get = x
    method set y = x &lt;- y
  end;;
val make : 'a -&gt; &lt; get : 'a; set : 'a -&gt; unit &gt; = &lt;fun&gt;
# let p = make 5;;
val p : &lt; get : int; set : int -&gt; unit &gt; = &lt;obj&gt;
# p#get;;
- : int = 5
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that the types of the function <literal>make</literal> and
      the returned object now use the polymorphic type
      <literal>'a</literal>. When make is invoked on a concrete value
      <literal>5</literal>, we get the same object type as before, with
      type <literal>int</literal> for the value.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="object-polymorphism">
    <title>Object Polymorphism</title>
    <para>
      Functions can also take object arguments. Let's construct a new
      object <literal>average</literal> that returns the average of any
      two objects with a <literal>get</literal> method.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

  &lt; get : int; .. &gt; -&gt;
  &lt; get : int &gt; = &lt;fun&gt;

    <para>
      There's some new syntax in the type that's been inferred for
      <literal>average</literal> here. The parameters have the object
      type <literal>&lt; get : int; .. &gt;</literal>. The
      <literal>..</literal> are ellipsis, standing for any other
      methods. The type <literal>&lt; get : int; .. &gt;</literal>
      specifies an object that must have at least a
      <literal>get</literal> method, and possibly some others as well.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can use the <literal>average</literal> using the normal object
      invocation syntax:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let p1 = make 5;;
# let p2 = make 15;;
# let a = average p1 p2;;
# a#get;;
- : int = 10
# p2#set 25;;
# a#get;;
- : int = 15
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The potential extra parameters defined by the object are carefully
      tracked by the OCaml type checker. If we manually try and
      constrain the exact type <literal>&lt; get : int &gt;</literal>
      for an object with more methods, type inference will fail.
    </para>

      constructed one, and so did <literal>average</literal>. When the

      Inheritance uses an existing class to define a new one. For

      Our first example mimics the <literal>md5</literal> command, which
      reads in an input file and returns a hexadecimal representation of
      its MD5 cryptographic hash. Cryptokit defines a number of
      different functions and collects them together under the

      Concrete hash objects can be instantiated from various sub-modules

      Message Authenticate Code for that particular hash function.

      Hash objects hold state and are thus naturally imperative. Once

      erased via <literal>wipe</literal>. The

      After opening the right modules, we read in the entire standard

      Now let's try something more advanced. The

    <para>
      We've selected the <literal>-nosalt</literal> option here to make

      derive these results is described in the
      <literal>man EVP_BytesToKey</literal> manual page (you may need to
      install the OpenSSL documentation packages on your system first).
      We can implement this derivation function using an imperative

    <para>
      The derivation algorithm takes an input password and desired total
      length (the addition of the key and IV length). It initialises a
      <literal>Hexa.encode</literal> transformer, which will accept
      arbitrary binary data and output a hexadecimal string (with two
      output bytes per input byte). A reference stores the last digest
      that's been calculated, and then the algorithm iterates until it
      has sufficient data to satisfy the required key length.
    </para>
    <para>
      Notice how the encoder object is used as an accumulator, by using
      the <literal>put_string</literal> and
      <literal>available_output</literal> to keep track of progress.
      Objects don't <emphasis>require</emphasis> an imperative style
      though, and the same algorithm can be written more functionally:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let evp_byte_to_key password tlen =

</programlisting>
    <para>
      In this version, we don't use any references, and instead a
      recursive function keeps track of the last digest in use and the
      accumulated result string. This version isn't quite as efficient
      as the previous one due to the careless use of string
      concatenation for the accumulator, but this can easily be fixed by
      using the <literal>Buffer</literal> module instead.

      that must be provided as arguments when the object is created with
      <literal>new</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's build an example of an imperative singly-linked list using
      object-oriented techniques. First, we'll want to define a class
      for a single element of the list. We'll call it a
      <literal>node</literal>, and it will hold a value of type
      <literal>'a</literal>. When defining the class, the type
      parameters are placed in square brackets before the class name in
      the class definition. We also need a parameter
      <literal>x</literal> for the initial value.
    </para>

      The <literal>value</literal> is the value stored in the node, and
      it can be retrieved and changed with the <literal>get</literal>
      and <literal>set</literal> methods. The
      <literal>next_node</literal> field is the link to the next element
      in the stack. Note that the type parameter <literal>['a]</literal>
      in the definition uses square brackets, but other uses of the type
      can omit them (or use parentheses if there is more than one type
      parameter).
    </para>
    <para>
      The type annotations on the <literal>val</literal> declarations
      are used to constrain type inference. If we omit these
      annotations, the type inferred for the class will be &quot;too

    <para>
      In general, we need to provide enough constraints so that the
      compiler will infer the correct type. We can add type constraints
      to the parameters, to the fields, and to the methods. It is a
      matter of preference how many constraints to add. You can add type
      constraints in all three places, but the extra text may not help
      clarity. A convenient middle ground is to annotate the fields
      and/or class parameters, and add constraints to methods only if
      necessary.

      This definition of the class <literal>slist</literal> is not
      complete, we can construct lists, but we also need to add the
      ability to traverse the elements in the list. One common style for
      doing this is to define a class for an <literal>iterator</literal>
      object. An iterator provides a generic mechanism to inspect and
      traverse the elements of a collection. This pattern isn't
      restricted to lists, it can be used for many different kinds of
      collections.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are two common styles for defining abstract interfaces like
      this. In Java, an iterator would normally be specified with an
      interface, which specifies a set of method types. In languages
      without interfaces, like C++, the specification would normally use
      <emphasis>abstract</emphasis> classes to specify the methods
      without implementing them (C++ uses the &quot;= 0&quot; definition
      to mean &quot;not implemented&quot;).

  virtual void next() = 0;
};
</programlisting>
    <para>
      OCaml support both styles. In fact, OCaml is more flexible than
      these approaches because an object type can be implemented by any
      object with the appropriate methods; it does not have to be
      specified by the object's class <emphasis>a priori</emphasis>.
      We'll leave abstract classes for later. Let's demonstrate the
      technique using object types.

      Next, we'll define an actual iterator for the class

      class to produce an iterator. To do so, we construct an
      <literal>slist_iterator</literal> that refers to the first node in
      the list, but we want to return a value with the object type
      <literal>iterator</literal>. This requires an explicit coercion
      using the <literal>:&gt;</literal> operator.

      What about functional operations similar to
      <literal>List.map</literal> or <literal>List.fold</literal>? In
      general, these methods take a function that produces a value of
      some other type than the elements of the set. For example, the
      function <literal>List.fold</literal> has type
      <literal>'a list -&gt; ('b -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b</literal>,
      where <literal>'b</literal> is an arbitrary type. To replicate
      this in the <literal>slist</literal> class, we need a method type
      <literal>('b -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'b</literal>, where

      The solution is to use a type quantifier, as shown in the

      We have multiple choices in defining the module type, depending on

      The abstract signature is simple because we ignore the classes.
      But what if we want to include them in the signature, so that
      other modules can inherit from the class definitions? For this, we
      need to specify types for the classes, called <emphasis>class
      types</emphasis>. Class types do not appear in mainstream
      object-oriented programming languages, so you may not be familiar
      with them, but the concept is pretty simple. A class type
      specifies the type of each of the visible parts of the class,
      including both fields and methods. Just like for module types, you
      don't have to give a type for everything; anything you omit will
      be hidden.

      as well as the types of each of the methods. We've also included a
      class type for <literal>slist_iterator</literal>, which is of

      One more thing, in this example the function

      that? In fact, what we've said is entirely true, classes and class
      names <emphasis>are not</emphasis> types. However, class names can
      be used to stand for types. When the compiler sees a class name in
      type position, it automatically constructs an object type from it

    <title>Subtyping</title>
    <para>
      Subtyping is a central concept in object-oriented programming. It
      governs when an object with one type <emphasis>A</emphasis> can be
      used in an expression that expects an object of another type
      <emphasis>B</emphasis>. When this is true, we say that
      <emphasis>A</emphasis> is a <emphasis>subtype</emphasis> of
      <emphasis>B</emphasis>. Actually, more concretely, subtyping
      determines when the coercion operator <literal>e :&gt; t</literal>
      can be applied. This coercion works only if the expression
      <literal>e</literal> has some type <literal>s</literal> and
      <literal>s</literal> is a subtype of <literal>t</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      To explore this, let's define some simple classes for geometric
      shapes. The generic type <literal>shape</literal> has a method to
      compute the area, and a <literal>square</literal> is a specific
      kind of shape.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

    <para>
      A <literal>square</literal> has a method <literal>area</literal>
      just like a <literal>shape</literal>, and an additional method
      <literal>width</literal>. Still, we expect a
      <literal>square</literal> to be a <literal>shape</literal>, and it
      is. The coercion <literal>:&gt;</literal> must be explicit.

    <para>
      What are the rules for subtyping? In general, object subtyping has
      two general forms, called <emphasis>width</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>depth</emphasis> subtyping. Width subtyping means that
      an object type <emphasis>A</emphasis> is a a subtype of
      <emphasis>B</emphasis>, if <emphasis>A</emphasis> has all of the
      methods of <emphasis>B</emphasis>, and possibly more. A
      <literal>square</literal> is a subtype of <literal>shape</literal>
      because it implements all of the methods of
      <literal>shape</literal> (the <literal>area</literal> method).
    </para>
    <para>
      The subtyping rules are purely technical, they have no relation to
      object semantics. We can define a class
      <literal>rectangle</literal> that has all of the methods of a
      <literal>square</literal>, so it is a subtype of square and can be
      used wherever a <literal>square</literal> is expected.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# class rectangle h w =
  object (self : 'self)

</programlisting>
    <para>
      This may seem absurd, but this concept is expressible in all
      object-oriented languages. The contradiction is semantic -- we
      know that in the real world, not all rectangles are squares; but
      in the programming world, rectangles have all of the features of
      squares (according to our definition), so they can be used just
      like squares. Suffice it to say that it is usually better to avoid
      such apparent contradictions.
    </para>
    <para>
      Next, let's take a seemingly tiny step forward, and start building
      collections of shapes. It is easy enough to define a
      <literal>slist</literal> of squares.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

    <para>
      We can also define a function to calculate the total area of a
      list of shapes. There is no reason to restrict this to squares, it
      should work for any list of shapes with type
      <literal>shape slist</literal>. The problem is that doing so
      raises some serious typing questions -- can a
      <literal>square slist</literal> be passed to a function that
      expects a <literal>shape slist</literal>? If we try it, the
      compiler produces a verbose error message.

      It might seem tempting to give up at this point, especially
      because the subtyping is not even true -- the type
      <literal>square slist</literal> is not a subtype of
      <literal>shape slist</literal>. The problem is with the
      <literal>insert</literal> method. For
      <literal>shape slist</literal>, the <literal>insert</literal>
      method takes an arbitrary <literal>shape</literal> and inserts it
      into the list. So if we could coerce a
      <literal>square slist</literal> to a
      <literal>shape slist</literal>, then it would be possible to
      insert an arbitrary shape into the list, which would be an error.

      <para>
        Why does this work, why is a <literal>square slist</literal> a
        subtype of <literal>readonly_shape_slist</literal>. The
        reasoning is in two steps. First, the easy part is width
        subtyping: we can drop the other methods to see that
        <literal>square slist</literal> is a subtype of
        <literal>&lt; iterator : square iterator &gt;</literal>. The
        next step is to use <emphasis>depth</emphasis> subtyping, which,
        in its general form, says that an object type
        <literal>&lt; m : t1 &gt;</literal> is a subtype of a type
        <literal>&lt; m : t2&gt;</literal> iff <literal>t1</literal> is
        a subtype of <literal>t2</literal>. In other words, instead of
        reasoning about the number of methods in a type (the width), the
        number of methods is fixed, and we look within the method types
        themselves (the &quot;depth&quot;).
      </para>
      <para>
        In this particular case, depth subtyping on the
        <literal>iterator</literal> method requires that
        <literal>square iterator</literal> be a subtype of
        <literal>shape iterator</literal>. Expanding the type definition
        for the type <literal>iterator</literal>, we again invoke depth
        subtyping, and we need to show that the type
        <literal>&lt; get : square &gt;</literal> is a subtype of
        <literal>&lt;get : shape &gt;</literal>, which follows because
        <literal>square</literal> is a subtype of
        <literal>shape</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        This reasoning may seem fairly long and complicated, but it
        should be pointed out that this typing
        <emphasis>works</emphasis>, and in the end the type annotations
        are fairly minor. In most typed object-oriented languages, the
        coercion would simply not be possible. For example, in C++, a
        STL type <literal>slist&lt;T&gt;</literal> is invariant in
        <literal>T</literal>, it is simply not possible to use
        <literal>slist&lt;square&gt;</literal> where
        <literal>slist&lt;shape&gt;</literal> is expected (at least
        safely). The situation is similar in Java, although Java
        supports has an escape hatch that allows the program to fall
        back to dynamic typing. The situation in OCaml is much better;
        it works, it is statically checked, and the annotations are
        pretty simple.

    <sect2 id="using-elided-types-to-address-subtyping-problems">
      <title>Using elided types to address subtyping problems</title>
      <para>
        Before we move to the next topic, there is one more thing to
        address. The typing we gave above, using
        <literal>readonly_shape_slist</literal>, requires that the
        caller perform an explicit coercion before calling the
        <literal>total_area</literal> function. We would like to give a
        better type that avoids the coercion.
      </para>
      <para>
        A solution is to use an elided type. Instead of
        <literal>shape</literal>, we can use the elided type
        <literal>&lt; area : float; .. &gt;</literal>. In fact, once we
        do this, it also becomes possible to use the
        <literal>slist</literal> type.

- : float = 5.
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This works, and it removes the need for explicit coercions. This
        type is still fairly simple, but it does have the drawback that
        the programmer needs to remember that the types
        <literal>&lt; area : float; ..&gt;</literal> and
        <literal>shape</literal> are related.
      </para>
      <para>
        OCaml supports an abbreviation in this case, but it works only
        for classes, not object types. The type expression
        <literal># classname</literal> is an abbreviation for an elided
        type containing all of the methods in the named class, and more.
        Since <literal>shape</literal> is an object type, we can't write
        <literal>#shape</literal>. However, if a class definition is
        available, this abbreviation can be useful. The following
        definition is exactly equivalent to the preceeding.

    <sect2 id="narrowing">
      <title>Narrowing</title>
      <para>
        Narrowing, also called <emphasis>down casting</emphasis>, is the
        ability to coerce an object to one of its subtypes. For example,
        if we have a list of shapes <literal>shape slist</literal>, we
        might know (for some reason) what the actual type of each shape
        is. Perhaps we know that all objects in the list have type
        <literal>square</literal>. In this case,
        <emphasis>narrowing</emphasis> would allow the re-casting of the
        object from type <literal>shape</literal> to type
        <literal>square</literal>. Many languages support narrowing
        through dynamic type checking. For example, in Java, a coercion
        <literal>(Square) x</literal> is allowed if the value
        <literal>x</literal> has type <literal>Square</literal> or one
        of its subtypes; otherwise the coercion throws an exception.
      </para>
      <para>
        Narrowing is <emphasis>not permitted</emphasis> in OCaml.
        Period.
      </para>
      <para>
        Why? There are two reasonable explanations, one based on a
        design principle, and another technical (the technical reason is
        simple: it is hard to implement).
      </para>
      <para>
        The design argument is this: narrowing violates abstraction. In
        fact, with a structural typing system like in OCaml, narrowing
        would essentially provide the ability to enumerate the methods
        in an object. To check whether an object <literal>obj</literal>
        has some method <literal>foo : int</literal>, one would attempt
        a coercion <literal>(obj :&gt; &lt; foo : int &gt;)</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        More commonly, narrowing leads to poor object-oriented style.
        Consider the following Java code, which returns the name of a
        shape object.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
String GetShapeName(Shape s) {
  if (s instanceof Square) {
    return &quot;Square&quot;;
  } else if (s instanceof Circle) {
    return &quot;Circle&quot;;
  } else {
    return &quot;Other&quot;;
  }
}
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Most programmers would consider this code to be
        &quot;wrong.&quot; Instead of performing a case analysis on the
        type of object, it would be better to define a method to return
        the name of the shape. Instead of calling
        <literal>GetShapeName(s)</literal>, we should call
        <literal>s.Name()</literal> instead.
      </para>
      <para>
        However, the situation is not always so obvious. The following
        code checks whether an array of shapes looks like a
        &quot;barbell,&quot; composed to two <literal>Circle</literal>
        objects separated by a <literal>Line</literal>, where the
        circles have the same radius.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
boolean IsBarBell(Shape[] s) {
  return s.length == 3 &amp;&amp; (s[0] instanceof Circle) &amp;&amp;
    (s[1] instanceof Line) &amp;&amp; (s[2] instanceof Circle) &amp;&amp;
    ((Circle) s[0]).radius() == ((Circle) s[2]).radius();
}
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In this case, it is much less clear how to augment the
        <literal>Shape</literal> class to support this kind of pattern
        analysis. It is also not obvious that object-oriented
        programming is well-suited for this situation. Pattern matching
        seems like a better fit.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
let is_bar_bell = function
 | [Circle r1; Line _; Circle r2] when r1 == r2 -&gt; true
 | _ -&gt; false;;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Regardless, there is a solution if you find yourself in this
        situation, which is to augment the classes with variants. You
        can define a method <literal>variant</literal> that injects the
        actual object into a variant type.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
type shape = &lt; variant : repr; area : float&gt;
and circle = &lt; variant : repr; area : float; radius : float &gt;
and line = &lt; variant : repr; area : float; length : float &gt;
and repr =
 | Circle of circle
 | Line of line;;
 
let is_bar_bell = function
 | [s1; s2; s3] -&gt;

      <para>
        This pattern works, but it has drawbacks. In particular, the
        recursive type definition should make it clear that this pattern
        is essentially equivalent to using variants, and that objects do
        not provide much value here.

        The problem is that a <literal>square</literal> expects to be

      <para>
        This problem is fundamental. Many languages solve it either with
        narrowing (with dynamic type checking), or by method
        overloading. Since OCaml has neither of these, what can we do?
      </para>
      <para>
        One proposal we could consider is, since the problematic method
        is equality, why not just drop it from the base type
        <literal>shape</literal> and use polymorphic equality instead?
        Unfortunately, the builtin equality has very poor behavior when
        applied to objects.

</programlisting>
      <para>
        The problem here is that the builtin polymorphic equality
        compares the method implementations, not their return values.
        The method implementations (the function values that implement
        the methods) are different, so the equality comparison is false.
        There are other reasons not to use the builtin polymorphic
        equality, but these false negatives are a showstopper.
      </para>
      <para>
        If we want to define equality for shapes in general, the
        remaining solution is to use the same approach as we described
        for narrowing. That is, introduce a
        <emphasis>representation</emphasis> type implemented using
        variants, and implement the comparison based on the
        representation type.

      Yet another reason for private methods is to factor the

      labels of its children. One efficient implementation is to use an
      array to represent the values, where the root is at index 0, and
      the children of a parent node at index <literal>i</literal> are at
      indexes <literal>2 * i</literal> and <literal>2 * i + 1</literal>.
      To insert a node into the tree, we add it as a leaf, and then

      This level of dependency on the implementation details is

      the concrete class? Virtual classes are better suited for
      situations where there are multiple (useful) implementations of
      the virtual parts. In most cases, this will be public virtual

      extends the variety of ways in which classes can be combined, and
      it can be quite useful, particularly with virtual classes.

        The main &quot;trickiness&quot; of multiple inheritance is due

        is defined in more than one class?
      </para>
      <para>
        If there is one thing to remember about inheritance in OCaml, it

        look at some artificial, but illustrative, examples.

        First, let's consider what happens when we define a method more
        than once. In the following example, the method
        <literal>get</literal> is defined twice; the second definition
        &quot;wins,&quot; meaning that it overrides the first one.

        Of course, it is unlikely that you will define two methods or
        two fields of the same name in the same class. However, the
        rules for inheritance follow the same pattern: the last
        definition wins. In the following definition, the
        <literal>inherit</literal> declaration comes last, so the method
        definition <literal>method get = 2</literal> overrides the
        previous definition, always returning 2.

        To reiterate, to understand what inheritance means, replace each
        <literal>inherit</literal> directive with its definition, and
        take the last definition of each method or field. This holds
        even for private methods. However, it does
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> hold for private methods that are
        &quot;really&quot; private, meaning that they have been hidden
        by a type constraint. In the following definitions, there are
        three definitions of the private method <literal>g</literal>.
        However, the definition of <literal>g</literal> in

        When should you use multiple inheritance? If you ask multiple
        people, you're likely to get multiple (perhaps heated) answers.
        Some will argue that multiple inheritance is overly complicated;
        others will argue that inheritance is problematic in general,
        and one should use object composition instead. But regardless of
        who you talk to, you will rarely hear that multiple inheritance
        is great and you should use it widely.
      </para>
      <para>
        In any case, if you're programming with objects, there's one
        general pattern for multiple inheritance that is both useful and
        reasonably simple, the <emphasis>mixin</emphasis> pattern.
        Generically, a <emphasis>mixin</emphasis> is just a virtual
        class that implements a feature based on another one. If you
        have a class that implements methods <emphasis>A</emphasis>, and
        you have a mixin <emphasis>M</emphasis> that provides methods
        <emphasis>B</emphasis> from <emphasis>A</emphasis>, then you can
        inherit from <emphasis>M</emphasis> -- &quot;mixing&quot; it in
        -- to get features <emphasis>B</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        That's too abstract, so let's give an example based on
        collections. In Section XXX:Objecttypes, we introduced the
        <emphasis>iterator</emphasis> pattern, where an
        <emphasis>iterator</emphasis> object is used to enumerate the
        elements of a collection. Lots of containers can have iterators,
        singly-linked lists, dictionaries, vectors, etc.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
type 'a iterator = &lt; get : 'a; has_value : bool; next : unit &gt;;;

class ['a] deque : object ... method iterator : 'a iterator end;;
class ['a, 'b] map : object ... method iterator : 'b iterator end;;
...
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The collections are different is some ways, but they share a
        common pattern for iteration that we can re-use. For a simple
        example, let's define a mixin that implements an arithmetic sum
        for a collection of integers.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# class virtual int_sum_mixin =
  object (self : 'self)
     method virtual iterator : int iterator

        let it = self#iterator in

        while it#has_value do
           total := !total + it#get;
           it#next

# l#sum;;
- : int = 17
# class int_deque =
  object
     inherit [int] deque
     inherit int_sum_mixin
  end;;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In this particular case, the mixin works only for a collection
        of integers, so we can't add the mixin to the polymorphic class
        definition <literal>['a] slist</literal> itself. However, the
        result of using the mixin is that the integer collection has a
        method <literal>sum</literal>, and it is done with very little
        of the fuss we would need if we used object composition instead.
      </para>
      <para>
        The mixin pattern isn't limited to non-polymorphic classes, of
        course. We can use it to implement generic features as well. The
        following mixin defines functional-style iteration in terms of
        the imperative iterator pattern.

    Lots of programming problems require dealing with data organized as
    key/value pairs. Maybe the simplest way of representing sets of
    key/value pairs in OCaml is an <emphasis>association
    list</emphasis>, which is simply a list of pairs of keys and values.
    For example, you could represent a mapping between the 10 digits and
    their English names as follows.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let digit_alist =
    [ 0, &quot;zero&quot;; 1, &quot;one&quot;; 2, &quot;two&quot;  ; 3, &quot;three&quot;; 4, &quot;four&quot;
    ; 5, &quot;five&quot;; 6, &quot;six&quot;; 7, &quot;seven&quot;; 8, &quot;eight&quot;; 9, &quot;nine&quot; ]
  ;;
</programlisting>
  <para>
    We can use functions from the <literal>List.Assoc</literal> module
    to manipulate such an association list.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# List.Assoc.find digit_alist 6;;
- : string option = Some &quot;six&quot;
# List.Assoc.find digit_alist 22;;
- : string option = None
# List.Assoc.add digit_alist 0 &quot;zilch&quot;;;
- : (int, string) List.Assoc.t =
[(0, &quot;zilch&quot;); (1, &quot;one&quot;); (2, &quot;two&quot;); (3, &quot;three&quot;); (4, &quot;four&quot;);
 (5, &quot;five&quot;); (6, &quot;six&quot;); (7, &quot;seven&quot;); (8, &quot;eight&quot;); (9, &quot;nine&quot;)]
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Association lists are simple and easy to use, but their performance
    is not ideal, since almost every non-trivial operation on an
    association list requires a linear-time scan of the list.
  </para>
  <para>
    In this chapter, we'll talk about two more efficient alternatives to
    association lists: <emphasis>maps</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>hashtables</emphasis>. A map is an immutable tree-based
    data structure where most operations take time logarithmic in the
    size of the map, whereas a hashtable is a mutable data structure
    where most operations have constant time complexity. We'll describe
    both of these data structures in detail, and provide some advice as
    to how to choose between them.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="a-map-example">
    <title>A map example</title>
    <para>
      Let's start by considering an example of how one might use a map
      in practice. In
      <xref linkend="files-modules-and-programs"/>, we showed
      a module <literal>Counter</literal> for keeping counts on a set of
      strings. Here's the interface.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* counter.mli *)

type t

val empty : t
val to_list : t -&gt; (string * int) list
val touch : t -&gt; string -&gt; t
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The intended behavior here is straightforward.
      <literal>Counter.empty</literal> represents an empty collection of
      counts; <literal>touch</literal> increments the count of the
      specified string by 1; and <literal>to_list</literal> returns the
      list of non-zero string/count pairs.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's the implementation.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* counter.ml *)
open Core.Std

type t = int String.Map.t

let empty = String.Map.empty

let to_list t = Map.to_alist t

let touch t s =
  let count = Option.value ~default:0 (Map.find t s) in
  Map.add t ~key:s ~data:(count + 1)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that in some places the above code refers to
      <literal>String.Map.t</literal>, and in others
      <literal>Map.t</literal>. This has to do with the fact that maps
      are implemented as ordered binary trees, and as such, need a way
      of comparing keys.
    </para>
    <para>
      To deal with this, a map, once created, stores the necessary
      comparison function within the data structure. Thus, operations
      like <literal>Map.find</literal> or <literal>Map.add</literal>
      that access the contents of a map, or create a new map from an
      existing one, do so by using the comparison function embedded
      within the map.
    </para>
    <para>
      But in order to get a map in the first place, you need to get your
      hands on the comparison function somehow. For this reason, modules
      like <literal>String</literal> contain a <literal>Map</literal>
      sub-module that have values like
      <literal>String.Map.empty</literal> and
      <literal>String.Map.of_alist</literal> that are specialized to
      strings, and this have access to a string comparison function.
      Such a <literal>Map</literal> sub-module is included in any module
      that satisfies the <literal>Comparable</literal> interface from
      Core.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="creating-maps-with-comparators">
    <title>Creating maps with comparators</title>
    <para>
      The specialized <literal>Map</literal> sub-module is convenient,
      but you don't necessarily need to use it to create a
      <literal>Map.t</literal>. The information required to compare
      values of a given type is wrapped up in a value called a
      <emphasis>comparator</emphasis>, that can be used to create maps
      using the <literal>Map</literal> module directly.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let digit_map = Map.of_alist_exn digit_alist
                     ~comparator:Int.comparator;;

# Map.find digit_map 3;;

</programlisting>
    <para>
      The above uses <literal>Map.of_alist_exn</literal> which creates a
      map from an association list, throwing an exception if there are
      duplicate keys in the list.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that the comparator is only required for operations that
      create maps from scratch. Operations that update an existing map
      simply inherit the comparator of the map they start with.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let zilch_map = Map.add digit_map ~key:0 ~data:&quot;zilch&quot;;;
val zilch_map : (int, string, Int.comparator) Map.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The type <literal>Map.t</literal> has three type parameters: one
      for the key, one for the value, and one to identify the comparator
      used to build the map. Indeed, the type
      <literal>'a Int.Map.t</literal> is just a type alias for
      <literal>(int,'a,Int.comparator) Map.t</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
      Including the comparator in the type is important because because
      operations that work on multiple maps at the same time often
      require that the maps share their comparison function. Consider,
      for example, <literal>Map.symmetric_diff</literal>, which computes
      a summary of the differences between two maps.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let left = String.Map.of_alist_exn [&quot;foo&quot;,1; &quot;bar&quot;,3; &quot;snoo&quot;, 0]

  [(&quot;foo&quot;, `Unequal (1, 0)); (&quot;bar&quot;, `Left 3)]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      If we look at the type of <literal>Map.symmetric_diff</literal>,
      we'll see that it requires that the two maps it compares have the
      same comparator type, in addition to the same key type and value
      type. Each comparator has a fresh abstract type, so the type of a
      comparator identifies it uniquely.

    <para>
      We could create a new comparator for an existing type using the
      <literal>Make</literal> functor found in the
      <literal>Comparator</literal> module. This functor takes as its
      input a module containing the type of the object to be compared,
      sexp-converter functions, and a comparison function. (The sexp
      converters are included in the comparator to make it possible for
      users of the comparator to generate better error messages.)

    <title>The polymorphic comparator</title>
    <para>
      We don't need to generate specialized comparators for every type
      we want to build a map on. We can instead use a comparator based
      on OCaml's polymorphic comparison function, which was discussed in
      <xref linkend="lists-and-patterns"/>. This comparator is
      found in the <literal>Map.Poly</literal> module. Thus, we can
      write:
    </para>

# Map.of_alist_exn Comparator.Poly.comparator digit_alist;;
- : (int, string, Comparator.Poly.comparator) Map.t = &lt;abstr&gt;

      Note that maps based on the polymorphic comparator are not
      equivalent to those based on the type-specific comparators from
      the point of view of the type system. Thus, the compiler rejects
      the following:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Map.symmetric_diff (Map.Poly.singleton 3 &quot;three&quot;)

      This is rejected for good reason: there's no guarantee that the

  <sect1 id="sets">
    <title>Sets</title>
    <para>
      Sometimes, instead of keeping track of a set of key/value pairs,
      you just want a data-type for keeping track of a set set of keys.
      You could just build this on top of the map type, by representing
      a set of values by a map where the type of the data is just
      <literal>unit</literal>. A more idiomatic (and more efficient)
      solution is to use Core's set type, which is similar in design and
      spirit to the map type. Here's a simple example:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

      In addition to the operators you would expect to have in map,
      sets, also support other operations you would expect for sets,

      differences, as well as testing for whether one set is a subset of
      another.
    </para>
    <warning> <title> 
    The perils of polymorphic compare
    </title>
    <para>
      Polymorphic compare is highly convenient, but it has serious
      downsides as well, and should be used with care. The problem with
      polymorphic compare is that it has a fixed algorithm for comparing
      values of any type, and that that algorithm can sometimes yield
      surprising results.
    </para>
    <para>
      To understand what's wrong with polymorphic comparison, you need
      to consider how it works. Polymorphic compare is a structural
      comparison, operating directly on the runtime-representation of
      OCaml values, walking the structure of the values in question
      without regard for their type.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is convenient because it provides a comparison function that
      behaves as you would expect for most OCaml types. For example, on
      <literal>int</literal>s and <literal>float</literal>s it acts as
      you would expect a numeric comparison function to act. For simple
      containers like strings and lists and arrays it operates as a
      lexicographic comparator. And it provides a reasonable total
      comparison function for most OCaml types, excluding only things
      like closures and values from outside of the OCaml heap.
    </para>
    <para>
      But sometimes, a structural comparison is not what you want. Maps
      and Sets are a great example of this. Consider the following two
      sets.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (s1,s2) = (Int.Set.of_list [1;2],
                 Int.Set.of_list [2;1]);;
val s1 : Int.Set.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
val s2 : Int.Set.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Logically, these two sets should be equal, and that's the result
      that you get if you call <literal>Set.equal</literal> on them.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Set.equal s1 s2;;
- : bool = true
</programlisting>
    <para>
      But because the elements were added in different orders, the
      layout of the trees trees will be different, and so a structural
      comparison function will conclude that they're different.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's see what happens if we use polymorphic compare to test for
      equality by way of the <literal>=</literal> operator. Comparing
      the maps directly will fail at runtime because of the comparators
      stored within the sets contain function values.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# s1 = s2;;
Exception: (Invalid_argument &quot;equal: functional value&quot;).
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can however use the function <literal>Set.to_tree</literal> to
      expose the underlying tree without the attached comparator.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Set.to_tree s1 = Set.to_tree s2;;
- : bool = false
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This can cause real and quite subtle bugs. If, for example, you
      use a map whose keys contain sets, then the map built with the
      polymorphic comparator will behave incorrectly, separating out
      keys that should be aggregated together. Even worse, it will work
      sometimes and fail others, since if the sets are built in a
      consistent order, then they will work as expected, but once the
      order changes, the behavior will change.
    </para>
    <para>
      For this reason, it's preferable to avoid polymorphic compare for
      all but the smallest applications.

    It's tedious and error-prone to code all this manually for every

    The <literal>Command</literal> library also scales as you add more

missing anonymous argument: filename
</programlisting>
    <para>
      When we invoke this binary without any arguments, it outputs a
      help screen that informs you that a required argument
      <literal>filename</literal> is missing. Supplying the argument to
      the command results in <literal>do_hash</literal> being called,
      and the MD5 output being displayed to the standard output.

    <para>
      So how does all this work? Most of the interesting logic lies in
      how the specifications are defined. The
      <literal>Command.Spec</literal> module defines several combinators
      that can be chained together to define flags and anonymous
      arguments, what types they should map to, and whether to take
      special actions (such as interactive input) if certain fields are
      encountered.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's build the specification for a single argument that is
      specified directly on the command-line (this is known as an
      <emphasis>anonymous</emphasis> argument).
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
Command.Spec.(
  empty
  +&gt; anon (&quot;filename&quot; %: string)
)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The specification above begins with an <literal>empty</literal>
      value, and then chains more parameters via the
      <literal>+&gt;</literal> combinator. Our example uses the
      <literal>anon</literal> function to define a single anonymous
      parameter. Anonymous parameters are assigned a string name that is
      used in help text, and an OCaml type that they are parsed into
      from the raw command-line string. The example
      <literal>filename</literal> argument above is extracted from the
      command-line and kept as an OCaml <literal>string</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      This specification is then bundled together with the callback
      functions using <literal>Command.basic</literal>. For our
      <literal>md5</literal> example, we have:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
Command.basic
  ~summary:&quot;Generate an MD5 hash of the input data&quot;
  ~readme:(fun () -&gt; &quot;More detailed information&quot;)
  Command.Spec.(
    empty
    +&gt; anon (&quot;filename&quot; %: string)
  )
  (fun file () -&gt; do_hash file)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>basic</literal> function takes a few more arguments
      in addition to the specification. The <literal>summary</literal>
      is a one-line description to go at the top of the command help
      screen, while <literal>readme</literal> is for longer help text
      when the command is called with <literal>-help</literal>. The
      <literal>readme</literal> argument is a function that is only
      evaluated when the help text is actually needed.
    </para>
    <para>
      The final argument is the callback function where all the actual
      work happens after the command-line parsing is complete. This
      function will be applied with the parsed command-line arguments,
      and should perform the actual work. In our example, we had just
      one anonymous argument, so the callback function just has a single
      <literal>string</literal> parameter applied to it:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(fun file () -&gt; do_hash file)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The function also needs an extra <literal>unit</literal> argument
      after <literal>file</literal>. This is simply so that the command
      specifications can work even when they are empty
      (<literal>Command.Spec.empty</literal>). Every OCaml function
      needs at least one argument, so the final <literal>unit</literal>
      guarantees that it will not be evaluated immediately as a value if
      there are no other arguments.
    </para>
    <para>
      You aren't just limited to parsing command lines as strings of
      course. <literal>Command.Spec</literal> defines several other
      conversion functions that validate and parse input into various
      types:

      A more realistic <literal>md5</literal> function might also read
      from the standard input if a filename isn't specified. We can
      change our specification with a single line to reflect this by
      writing:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
Command.Spec.(
  empty
  +&gt; anon (maybe (&quot;filename&quot; %: string))
)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The anonymous parameter has been prefixed with a
      <literal>maybe</literal> that indicates the value is now optional.
      If you compile the example, you'll get a type error though:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
File &quot;md5_broken.ml&quot;, line 18, characters 26-30:
Error: This expression has type string option
       but an expression was expected of type string
Command exited with code 2.
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This is because the type of the callback function has changed. It
      now wants a <literal>string option</literal> instead of a
      <literal>string</literal> since the value is optional. We can
      quickly adapt our example to use the new information and read from
      standard input if no file is specified.

      You can get pretty far by combining flags and anonymous arguments
      to assemble complex command-line interfaces. After a while though,
      too many options can make the program very confusing for newcomers
      to your application. One way to solve this is by grouping common
      operations together and adding some hierarchy to the command-line
      interface.

      You'll have run across this style already when using the OPAM
      package manager (or, in the non-OCaml world, the Git or Mercurial

      <literal>Command.t</literal> values and their corresponding names.

      Let's build the beginning of a calendar tool that does a few
      operations over dates from the command line. We first define a
      command that adds days to an input date and prints the resulting
      date.

    <para>
      The use of the spec combinators has been somewhat magic so far: we
      just build them up with the '+&gt;' combinator and things seem to
      work. As your programs get larger and more complex, you'll want to
      factor out common functionality between specifications. Some other
      times, you'll need to interrupt the parsing to perform special
      processing, such as requesting an interactive passphrase from the
      user before proceeding. We'll show you some new combinators that
      let you do this now.
    </para>
    <sidebar>
    <title>
    The types behind <literal>Command.Spec</literal>
    </title>
    <para>
      The Command module's safety relies on the specification's output
      values precisely matching the callback function which invokes the
      main program. Any mismatch here will inevitably result in a
      dynamic failure, and so Command uses some interesting type
      abstraction to guarantee they remain in sync. You don't have to
      understand this section to use the more advanced combinators, but
      it'll help you debug type errors as you use
      <literal>Command</literal> more.
    </para>
    <para>
      The type of <literal>Command.t</literal> looks deceptively simple:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
type ('main_in, 'main_out) t
</programlisting>
    <para>
      You can think of <literal>('a, 'b) t</literal> as a function of
      type <literal>'a -&gt; 'b</literal>, but embellished with
      information about:

    <para>
      The type of a specification transforms a
      <literal>'main_in</literal> to a <literal>'main_out</literal>
      value. For instance, a value of <literal>Spec.t</literal> might
      have type:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(arg1 -&gt; ... -&gt; argN -&gt; 'r, 'r) Spec.t
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Such a value transforms a main function of type
      <literal>arg1 -&gt; ... -&gt; argN -&gt; 'r</literal> by supplying
      all the argument values, leaving a main function that returns a
      value of type <literal>'r</literal>. Let's look at some examples
      of specs, and their types:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Command.Spec.empty ;;
- : ('m, 'm) Spec.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# Command.Spec.(empty +&gt; anon (&quot;foo&quot; %: int)) ;;
- : (int -&gt; '_a, '_a) Command.Spec.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The empty specification is simple as it doesn't add any parameters
      to the callback type. The second example adds an
      <literal>int</literal> anonymous parameter that is reflected in
      the inferred type. One forms a command by combining a spec of type
      <literal>('main, unit) Spec.t</literal> with a function of type
      <literal>'main</literal>. The combinators we've shown so far
      incrementally build the type of <literal>'main</literal> according
      to the command-line parameters it expects, so the resulting type
      of <literal>'main</literal> is something like
      <literal>arg1 -&gt; ... -&gt; argN -&gt; unit</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The type of <literal>Command.basic</literal> should make more
      sense now:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
val basic :
  summary:string -&gt;
  ?readme:(unit -&gt; string) -&gt;
  ('main, unit -&gt; unit) Spec.t -&gt; 'main -&gt; t
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The final line is the important one. It shows that the callback
      function for a spec should consume identical arguments to the
      supplied <literal>main</literal> function, expect for an
      additional <literal>unit</literal> argument. This final
      <literal>unit</literal> is there to make sure the callback is
      evaluated as a function, since if zero command-line arguments are
      specified (i.e. <literal>Spec.empty</literal>), the callback would
      otherwise have no arguments and be evaluated immediately. That's
      why you have to supply an additional <literal>()</literal> to the
      callback function in all the previous examples.

        If you want to factor out common command-line operations, the

        together. Let's add some dummy verbosity and debug flags to our
        calendar application to illustrate this.

      <para>
        The definitions of the specifications are very similar to the
        earlier example, except that they append a
        <literal>common</literal> parameter after each specification. We
        can supply these flags when defining the groups:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
let () =
  let common =
    Command.Spec.(
      empty
      +&gt; flag &quot;-d&quot; (optional_with_default false bool) ~doc:&quot; Debug mode&quot;
      +&gt; flag &quot;-v&quot; (optional_with_default false bool) ~doc:&quot; Verbose output&quot;

  |&gt; Command.group ~summary:&quot;Manipulate dates&quot;
  |&gt; Command.run
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Both of these flags will now be applied and passed to all the
        callback functions. This makes code refactoring a breeze by
        using the compiler to spot places where you use commands. Just
        add a parameter to the common definition, run the compiler, and
        fix type errors until everything works again.
      </para>
      <para>
        For example, if we remove the <literal>verbose</literal> flag
        above and compile, we'll get this impressively long type error:

        While this does look scary, the key line to scan is the last
        one, where it's telling you that you have supplied too many
        arguments in the callback function
        (<literal>unit -&gt; unit</literal> vs <literal>unit</literal>).
        If you started with a working program and made this single
        change, you typically don't even need to read the type error, as
        the filename and location information is sufficient to make the
        obvious fix.

        this transformation. It applies its supplied callback function
        first, which checks if <literal>day</literal> is defined. If
        it's undefined, then it interactively reads an integer from the
        standard input. The first <literal>m</literal> argument to the
        <literal>step</literal> callback is the next callback function
        in the chain. The transformation is completed by calling
        <literal>m base days</literal> to continue processing with the

        value that is passed onto the next callback now has a

    <para>
      Modern UNIX shells usually have a tab-completion feature to
      interactively help you figure out how to build a command-line.
      These work by pressing the <literal>&lt;tab&gt;</literal> key in
      the middle of typing a command, and seeing the options that pop
      up. You've probably used this most often to find the files in the

      of the command too.

      The precise mechanism for autocompletion varies depending on what
      shell you are using, but we'll assume you are using the most
      common one: <literal>bash</literal>. This is the default
      interactive shell on most Linux distributions and Mac OS X, but

      Once you have bash completion installed and configured, check that
      it works by typing the <literal>ssh</literal> command, and
      pressing <literal>tab</literal>. This should show you the list of
      known hosts from your <literal>~/.ssh/known_hosts</literal> file.
      If it lists those, then you can continue on, but if it lists the

    Data serialization, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis> converting data to and
    from a sequence of bytes that's suitable for writing to disk or
    sending across the network, is an important and common programming
    task. Sometimes you need to match someone else's data format (such

    you just want something that is easy for humans to read and edit. To
    this end, OCaml comes with several techniques for data serialization
    depending on what your problem is.
  </para>
  <para>
    We'll start by using the popular and simple JSON data format, and
    then look at other serialization formats later in in the book. This

    <title>JSON Basics</title>
    <para>
      JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format often used in web
      services and browsers. It's described in
      <ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">RFC4627</ulink>,
      and is easier to parse and generate than alternatives such as XML.
      You'll run into JSON very often when working with modern web APIs,
      so we'll cover several different ways to manipulate it in this
      chapter.
    </para>
    <para>
      JSON consists of two basic structures: an unordered collection of
      key/value pairs, and an ordered list of values. Values can be
      strings, booleans, floats, integers or null. Let's see what a JSON
      record for an example book description looks like:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="json">
{
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Real World OCaml&quot;,
  &quot;tags&quot; : [ &quot;functional programming&quot;, &quot;ocaml&quot;, &quot;algorithms&quot; ],
  &quot;pages&quot;: 450,
  &quot;authors&quot;: [
    { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Jason Hickey&quot;, &quot;affiliation&quot;: &quot;Google&quot; },
    { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Anil Madhavapeddy&quot;, &quot;affiliation&quot;: &quot;Cambridge&quot;},
    { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Yaron Minsky&quot;, &quot;affiliation&quot;: &quot;Jane Street&quot;}
  ],
  &quot;is_online&quot;: true
}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The outermost JSON value is usually a record (delimited by the
      curly braces) and contains an unordered set of key/value pairs.
      The keys must be strings but values can be any JSON type. In the
      example above, <literal>tags</literal> is a string list, while the
      <literal>authors</literal> field contains a list of records.
      Unlike OCaml lists, JSON lists can contain multiple different JSON
      types within a single list.
    </para>
    <para>
      This free-form nature of JSON types is both a blessing and a
      curse. It's very easy to generate JSON values, but code that
      parses them also has to handle subtle variations in how the values
      are represented. For example, what if the <literal>pages</literal>
      value above is actually represented as a string value of
      <literal>&quot;450&quot;</literal> instead of an integer?
    </para>
    <para>
      Our first task is to parse the JSON into a more structured OCaml
      type so that we can use static typing more effectively. When
      manipulating JSON in Python or Ruby, you might write unit tests to
      check that you have handled unusual inputs. The OCaml model
      prefers compile-time static checking as well as unit tests. For
      example, using pattern matching can warn you if you've not checked
      that a value can be <literal>Null</literal> as well as contain an
      actual value.

    Installing the Yojson library

      There are several JSON libraries available for OCaml. For this

          Some of the type definitions are
          <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> (that is, one of the algebraic
          data types includes a reference to the name of the type being
          defined). Fields such as <literal>Assoc</literal> can contain
          references to more JSON fields, and thus precisely describe
          the underlying JSON data structure. The JSON
          <literal>List</literal> can contain fields of different types,
          unlike the OCaml <literal>list</literal> whose contents must

          The definition specifically includes a <literal>Null</literal>

      Let's parse the earlier JSON example into this type now. The first
      stop is the <literal>Yojson.Basic</literal> documentation, where
      we find these helpful functions:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
val from_string : ?buf:Bi_outbuf.t -&gt; ?fname:string -&gt; ?lnum:int -&gt; string -&gt; json

   [fname] : data file name to be used in error messages. It does not 
             have to be a real file. 
   [lnum]  : number of the first line of input. Default is 1.

</programlisting>
    <para>
      When first reading these interfaces, you can generally ignore the
      optional arguments (which have the question marks in the type
      signature), as they will be filled in with sensible values. In the
      above signature, the optional arguments offer finer control over
      the memory buffer allocation and error messages from parsing
      incorrect JSON.
    </para>
    <para>
      The type signature for these functions with the optional elements
      removed makes their purpose much clearer:

val from_file : string -&gt; json
val from_channel : in_channel -&gt; json

    <para>
      The <literal>in_channel</literal> constructor is from the original
      OCaml standard library, and its use is considered deprecated when
      using the Core standard library. This leaves us with two ways of
      parsing the JSON: either from a string or from a file on a
      filesystem. The next example shows both in action, assuming the
      JSON record is stored in a file called
      <literal>book.json</literal>.

      You can build this by writing a <literal>_tags</literal> file to
      define the package dependencies, and then running

    <para>
      The <literal>from_file</literal> function accepts an input
      filename and takes care of opening and closing it for you. It's
      far more common to use <literal>from_string</literal> to construct
      JSON values though, since these strings come in via a network
      connection (we'll see more of this in
      <xref linkend="concurrent-programming-with-async"/>) or
      a database. Finally, the example checks that the two input
      mechanisms actually resulted in the same OCaml data structure.
    </para>

    <title>
    The difference between <literal>=</literal> and
    <literal>==</literal>, and <literal>phys_equal</literal> in Core
    </title>
    <para>
      If you come from a C/C++ background, you will probably reflexively
      use <literal>==</literal> to test two values for equality. In
      OCaml, <literal>==</literal> tests for
      <emphasis>physical</emphasis> equality, and <literal>=</literal>
      tests for <emphasis>structural</emphasis> equality.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>==</literal> physical equality test will match if two
      data structures have precisely the same pointer in memory. Two
      data structures that have identical contents, but are constructed
      separately, will not match using this operator. In the JSON
      example, the <literal>json1</literal> and <literal>json2</literal>
      values are not identical and so would fail the physical equality
      test.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>=</literal> structural equality operator recursively
      inspects each field in the two values and tests them individually
      for equality. In the JSON parsing example, every field will be
      traversed and checked, and they will check out as equal.
      Crucially, if your data structure is cyclical (that is, a value
      recursively points back to another field within the same
      structure), the <literal>=</literal> operator will never
      terminate, and your program will hang! In this situation, you must
      use the physical equality operator, or write a custom comparison
      function that breaks the recursion.
    </para>
    <para>
      It's quite easy to mix up the use of <literal>=</literal> and
      <literal>==</literal>, so Core disables the <literal>==</literal>
      operator and provides the more explicit
      <literal>phys_equal</literal> function instead. You'll see a type
      error if you use <literal>==</literal> anywhere:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# 1 == 2;;
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
         [ `Consider_using_phys_equal ]
# phys_equal 1 2;;
- : bool = false
</programlisting>
    <para>
      If you feel like hanging your OCaml interpreter, you can verify
      what happens with recursive values and structural equality for
      yourself:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type t1 = { foo1:int; bar1:t2 } and t2 = { foo2:int; bar2:t1 } ;;
type t1 = { foo1 : int; bar1 : t2; }
and t2 = { foo2 : int; bar2 : t1; }
# let rec v1 = { foo1=1; bar1=v2 } and v2 = { foo2=2; bar2=v1 };;

# v1 == v1;;

    Functional Combinators
    </title>
    <para>
      Combinators are a design pattern that crops up quite often in
      functional programming. John Hughes defines them as &quot;a
      function which builds program fragments from program
      fragments&quot;. In a functional language, this generally means
      higher-order functions that combine other functions to apply
      useful transformations over values.
    </para>
    <para>
      You've already run across several of these in the
      <literal>List</literal> module:

</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>map</literal> and <literal>fold</literal> are extremely
      common combinators that transform an input list by applying a
      function to each value of the list. The <literal>map</literal>
      combinator is simplest, with the resulting list being output
      directly. <literal>fold</literal> applies each value in the input
      list to a function that accumulates a single result, and returns
      that instead.

      function is applied to every value, but no result is supplied. The
      function must instead apply some side-effect such as changing a
      mutable record field or printing to the standard output.
    </para>
    </sidebar>
    <para>
      <literal>Yojson</literal> provides several combinators in the
      <literal>Yojson.Basic.Util</literal> module, such as:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
val member : string -&gt; json -&gt; json
val index : int -&gt; json -&gt; json
val to_string : json -&gt; string
val to_int : json -&gt; int
val filter_string : json list -&gt; string list
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We'll go through each of these uses one-by-one. Core provides the
      <literal>|&gt;</literal> pipe-forward which can chain combinators
      together, and the example code uses this to select and convert
      values out of the JSON structure. Let's examine some of them in
      more detail:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
  let open Yojson.Basic.Util in
  let title = json |&gt; member &quot;title&quot; |&gt; to_string in
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>member</literal> function accepts a JSON object and
      named key and returns the JSON field associated with that key, or
      <literal>Null</literal>. Since we know that the
      <literal>title</literal> value is always a string in our example
      schema, we want to convert it to an OCaml string. The
      <literal>to_string</literal> function performs this conversion,
      and raises an exception if there is an unexpected JSON type. The
      <literal>|&gt;</literal> operator provides a convenient way to
      chain these operations together.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
  let tags = json |&gt; member &quot;tags&quot; |&gt; to_list |&gt; filter_string in
  let pages = json |&gt; member &quot;pages&quot; |&gt; to_int in
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>tags</literal> field is similar to
      <literal>title</literal>, but the field is a list of strings
      instead of a single one. Converting this to an OCaml
      <literal>string list</literal> is a two stage process. First, we
      convert the JSON <literal>List</literal> to an OCaml list of JSON
      values, and then filter out the <literal>String</literal> values
      as an OCaml <literal>string list</literal>. Remember that OCaml
      lists must contain values of the same type, so any JSON values
      that cannot be converted to a <literal>string</literal> will be
      skipped from the output of <literal>filter_string</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
  let is_online = json |&gt; member &quot;is_online&quot; |&gt; to_bool_option in
  let is_translated = json |&gt; member &quot;is_translated&quot; |&gt; to_bool_option in
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>is_online</literal> and
      <literal>is_translated</literal> fields are optional in our JSON
      schema, so no error should be raised if they are not present. The
      OCaml type is a <literal>string option</literal> to reflect this,
      and can be extracted via <literal>to_bool_option</literal>. In our
      example JSON, only <literal>is_online</literal> is present and
      <literal>is_translated</literal> will be <literal>None</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
  let authors = json |&gt; member &quot;authors&quot; |&gt; to_list in
  let names = List.map authors ~f:(fun json -&gt; member &quot;name&quot; json |&gt; to_string) in
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The final use of JSON combinators is to extract all the
      <literal>name</literal> fields from the list of authors. We first
      construct the <literal>author list</literal>, and then
      <literal>map</literal> it into a <literal>string list</literal>.
      Notice that the example explicitly binds
      <literal>authors</literal> to a variable name. It can also be
      written more succinctly using the pipe-forward operator:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let names =
  json
  |&gt; member &quot;authors&quot;
  |&gt; to_list
  |&gt; List.map ~f:(fun json -&gt; member &quot;name&quot; json |&gt; to_string)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This style of programming which omits variable names and chains
      functions together is known as &quot;point-free programming&quot;.
      It's a succinct style, but shouldn't be overused due to the
      increased difficulty of debugging intermediate values. If an
      explicit name is assigned to each stage of the transformations,
      debuggers in particular have an easier time making the program
      flow easier to represent to the programer.
    </para>
    <para>
      This technique of using chained parsing functions is very powerful
      in combination with the OCaml type system. Many errors that don't
      make sense at runtime (for example, mixing up lists and objects)
      will be caught statically via a type error.

  <sect1 id="constructing-json-values">
    <title>Constructing JSON values</title>
    <para>
      Building and printing JSON values is pretty straightforward given
      the <literal>Yojson.Basic.json</literal> type. You can just
      construct values of type <literal>json</literal> and call the
      <literal>to_string</literal> function] on them. Let's remind
      ourselves of the <literal>Yojson.Basic.type</literal> again:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
type json = [
  | `Assoc of (string * json) list
  | `Bool of bool
  | `Float of float
  | `Int of int
  | `List of json list
  | `Null
  | `String of string ]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can directly build a JSON value against this type, and use the
      pretty-printing functions in the <literal>Yojson.Basic</literal>
      module to lay the output out in the JSON format.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let x = `Assoc [ (&quot;key&quot;, `String &quot;value&quot;) ] ;;
val x : [&gt; `Assoc of (string * [&gt; `String of string ]) list ] =
  `Assoc [(&quot;key&quot;, `String &quot;value&quot;)]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In the example above, we've constructed a value
      <literal>x</literal> that represents a simple JSON object. We
      haven't actually defined the type of <literal>x</literal>
      explicitly here, as we're relying on the magic of polymorphic
      variants to make this all work. The OCaml type system infers a
      type for <literal>x</literal> based on how you construct the
      value. In this case only the <literal>Assoc</literal> and
      <literal>String</literal> variants are used, and the inferred type
      only contains these fields without knowledge of the other possible
      variants that you haven't used yet.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_string ;;
- : ?std:bool -&gt; Yojson.Basic.json -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;  
</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>pretty_to_string</literal> has a more explicit signature
      that wants an argument of type
      <literal>Yojson.Basic.json</literal>. When <literal>x</literal> is
      applied to <literal>pretty_to_string</literal>, the inferred type
      of <literal>x</literal> is statically checked against the
      structure of the <literal>json</literal> type to ensure that
      they're compatible.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_string x ;;
- : string = &quot;{ \&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;value\&quot; }&quot;

# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_channel stdout x ;;
{ &quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot; }
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In this case, there are no problems. Our <literal>x</literal>
      value has an inferred type that is a valid sub-type of
      <literal>json</literal>, and the function application just works
      without us ever having to explicitly specify a type for
      <literal>x</literal>. Type inference lets you write more succinct
      code without sacrificing runtime reliability, as all the uses of
      polymorphic variants are still checked at compile-time.
    </para>
    <sidebar>
    <title>
    Polymorphic variants and easier type checking
    </title>
    <para>
      One difficulty you will encounter is that type errors involving
      polymorphic variants can be quite verbose if you make a mistake in
      your code. For example, suppose you build an
      <literal>Assoc</literal> and mistakenly include a single value
      instead of a list of keys:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let x = `Assoc (&quot;key&quot;, `String &quot;value&quot;);;
val x : [&gt; `Assoc of string * [&gt; `String of string ] ] =
  `Assoc (&quot;key&quot;, `String &quot;value&quot;)

# Yojson.Basic.pretty_to_string x;;
Error: This expression has type
         [&gt; `Assoc of string * [&gt; `String of string ] ]
       but an expression was expected of type Yojson.Basic.json
       Types for tag `Assoc are incompatible
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The type error above isn't <emphasis>wrong</emphasis> as such, but
      can be inconvenient to wade through for larger values. An easy way
      to narrow down this sort of type error is to add explicit type
      annotations as a compiler hint about your intentions:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (x:Yojson.Basic.json) = `Assoc (&quot;key&quot;, `String &quot;value&quot;);;
Error: This expression has type 'a * 'b
       but an expression was expected of type
         (string * Yojson.Basic.json) list
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In this case, we've marked the <literal>x</literal> as being of
      type <literal>Yojson.Basic.json</literal>, and the compiler
      immediately spots that the argument to the
      <literal>Assoc</literal> variant has the incorrect type. This
      illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of polymorphic variants:
      they make it possible to easily subtype across module boundaries,
      but the error messages can be more confusing. However, a bit of
      careful manual type annotation is all it takes to make tracking
      down such issues much easier.

  <sect1 id="using-non-standard-json-extensions">
    <title>Using non-standard JSON extensions</title>
    <para>
      The standard JSON types are <emphasis>really</emphasis> basic, and
      OCaml types are far more expressive. Yojson supports an extended
      JSON format for those times when you're not interoperating with
      external systems and just want a convenient human-readable local
      format. The <literal>Yojson.Safe.json</literal> type is a superset
      of the <literal>Basic</literal> polymorphic variant, and looks
      like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
type json = [
  | `Assoc of (string * json) list
  | `Bool of bool
  | `Float of float

  | `Null
  | `String of string
  | `Stringlit of string
  | `Tuple of json list
  | `Variant of string * json option ]
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>Safe.json</literal> type includes all of the variants
      from <literal>Basic.json</literal> and extends it with a few more
      useful ones. A standard JSON type such as a
      <literal>String</literal> will type-check against both the
      <literal>Basic</literal> module and also the non-standard
      <literal>Safe</literal> module. If you use the extension values
      with the <literal>Basic</literal> module however, the compiler
      will reject your code until you make it compliant with the
      portable subset of JSON.
    </para>

      Yojson supports the following JSON extensions:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The <literal>lit</literal> suffix denotes that the value is
          stored as a JSON string. For example, a
          <literal>Floatlit</literal> will be stored as
          <literal>&quot;1.234&quot;</literal> instead of
          <literal>1.234</literal>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The <literal>Tuple</literal> type is stored as
          <literal>(&quot;abc&quot;, 123)</literal> instead of a list.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The <literal>Variant</literal> type encodes OCaml variants

      The only purpose of these extensions is to make the data

      The combinators described earlier make it easy to write functions

      pretty manual. When you implement larger specifications, it's much
      easier to generate the mappings from JSON schemas to OCaml values

    Installing the ATDgen library and tool
    </title>
    <para>
      ATDgen installs some OCaml libraries that interface with Yojson,
      and also a command-line tool that generates code. It can all be
      installed via OPAM:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ opam install atdgen
$ atdgen -version
1.2.3
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The command-line tool will be installed within your
      <literal>~/.opam</literal> directory, and will already be on your
      <literal>PATH</literal> from running
      <literal>opam config env</literal>. See
      <xref linkend="installation"/> if this isn't working.
    </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      The idea behind ATD is to specify the format of the JSON in a
      separate file, and then run a compiler (<literal>atdgen</literal>)
      that outputs OCaml code to construct and parse JSON values. This
      means that you don't need to write any OCaml parsing code at all,
      as it will all be auto-generated for you.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's go straight into looking at an example of how this works, by
      using a small portion of the GitHub API. GitHub is a popular code
      hosting and sharing website that provides a JSON-based web
      <ulink url="http://developer.github.com">API</ulink>. The ATD code
      fragment below describes the GitHub authorization API. It is based
      on a pseudo-standard web protocol known as OAuth, and is used to
      authorize users for GitHub services.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
type scope = [
    User &lt;json name=&quot;user&quot;&gt;

}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      ATD specifications are deliberately similar to OCaml type
      definitions. Each field can include extra annotations to customise
      the parsing code for a particular backend. For example, the GitHub
      <literal>scope</literal> field above is defined as a variant type,
      but with the actual JSON values being defined explicitly (as
      lower-case versions).
    </para>
    <para>
      The ATD spec can be compiled to a number of OCaml targets. Let's
      run the compiler twice, to generate some OCaml type definitions,
      and a JSON serialiser.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="bash">
$ atdgen -t github.atd
$ atdgen -j github.atd
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This will generate some new files in your current directory.
      <literal>Github_t.ml</literal> and <literal>Github_t.mli</literal>
      will contain an OCaml module with types defines that correspond to
      the ATD file. The signature looks like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
type scope = [
  | `User | `Public_repo | `Repo | `Repo_status
  | `Delete_repo | `Gist
]

type app = {
  app_name (*atd name *): string;
  app_url (*atd url *): string
}

type authorization_request = {
  auth_req_scopes (*atd scopes *): scope list;
  auth_req_note (*atd note *): string
}

type authorization_response = {

  token: string;
  app: app;
  url: string;
  id: int;
  note: string option;
  note_url: string option
}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      There is an obvious correspondence to the ATD definition. Note
      that field names in OCaml records in the same module cannot shadow
      each other, and so we instruct ATDgen to prefix every field with a
      name that distinguishes it from other records in the same module.
      For example,
      <literal>&lt;ocaml field_prefix=&quot;auth_req_&quot;&gt;</literal>
      in the ATD spec prefixes every field name in the generated
      <literal>authorization_request</literal> record with
      <literal>auth_req</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>Github_t</literal> module only contains the type
      definitions, while <literal>Github_j</literal> provides
      serialization functions to and from JSON. You can read the
      <literal>github_j.mli</literal> to see the full interface, but the
      important functions for most uses are the conversion functions to
      and from a string. For our example above, this looks like:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
val string_of_authorization_response :
  ?len:int -&gt; authorization_response -&gt; string
  (** Serialize a value of type {!authorization_response}
      into a JSON string.
      @param len specifies the initial length
                 of the buffer used internally.

      This is pretty convenient! We've written a single ATD file, and
      all the OCaml boilerplate to convert between JSON and a strongly
      typed record has been generated for us. You can control various
      aspects of the serializer by passing flags to
      <literal>atdgen</literal>. The important ones for JSON are:

      The full ATD specification is quite sophisticated (and well
      documented online at its homepage). The ATD compiler can also
      target formats other than JSON, and outputs code for other
      languages such as Java if you need more interoperability. There
      are also several similar projects you can investigate which
      automate the code generation process:

        The JSON returned from the <literal>janestreet</literal> query
        is missing an organization name, but this is explicitly
        reflected in the OCaml type since the ATD spec marked
        <literal>name</literal> as an optional field. Our OCaml code
        explicitly handles this case and doesn't have to worry about
        null-pointer exceptions. Similarly, the JSON integer for the
        <literal>id</literal> is mapped into a native OCaml integer via
        the ATD conversion.
      </para>
      <para>
        While this tool is obviously quite simple, the ability to
        specify optional and default fields is very powerful. Take a
        look at the full ATD specification for the GitHub API in the
        <ulink url="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github"><literal>ocaml-github</literal></ulink>

        Our example shells out to <literal>curl</literal> on the

  <title>Parsing with OCamllex and Menhir</title>
  <para>
    OCaml provides lexer and parser generators modeled on lex and yacc.
    Similar tools are available in a variety of languages, and with them
    you can parse a variety of kinds of input, including web formats or
    full blown programming languages.
  </para>
  <para>
    Let's be more precise about these terms. By
    <emphasis>parsing</emphasis>, we mean reading a textual input into a
    form that is easier for a program to manipulate. For example,
    suppose we want to read a file containing a value in JSON format.
    JSON has a variety of values, including numbers, strings, arrays,
    and objects, and each of these has a precise textual representation.
    For example, the following text represents an object containing a
    string labeled <literal>title</literal>, and an array containing two
    objects, each with a name and array of zip codes.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="json">
{ title: &quot;Cities&quot;,
  cities: [{ name: &quot;Chicago&quot;, zips: [60601] },
           { name: &quot;New York&quot;, zips: [10004] }]
}
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The input text is represented as a sequence of characters.
    Manipulating it in that form would be really hard, so what we want
    is to give it a structured type that is easier for our programs to
    manipulate. For our example, we'll use the following type to
    represent JSON <emphasis>abstract syntax</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
type value = [
| `Object of (string * value) list
| `Array of value array
| `String of string
| `Int of int
| `Float of float
| `True
| `False
| `Null ]
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The objective of <emphasis>parsing</emphasis> is to convert the text
    input into a value of type <literal>value</literal>. This is
    normally done in two phase. First, <emphasis>lexical</emphasis>
    analysis (or lexing, for short) is used to convert the text input
    into a sequence of tokens, or words. For example, the JSON input
    would be tokenized into a sequence of tokens like the following. In
    most cases (and in this example), lexical analysis will choose to
    omit white space from the token stream.
  </para>
  <programlisting>
LEFT_BRACE, ID(&quot;title&quot;), COLON, STRING(&quot;Cities&quot;), COMMA, ID(&quot;cities&quot;), ...
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The next step is to convert the token stream into a program value
    that represents the abstract syntax tree, like the type
    <literal>value</literal> above. This is called
    <emphasis>parsing</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <programlisting>
`Object
  [&quot;title&quot;, `String &quot;Cities&quot;;
   &quot;cities&quot;, `Array
     [|`Object [&quot;name&quot;, `String &quot;Chicago&quot;; &quot;zips&quot;, `Array [|Int 60601|]];
       `Object [&quot;name&quot;, `String &quot;New York&quot;; &quot;zips&quot;, `Array [|Int 10004|]]|]]
</programlisting>
  <para>
    There are many techniques for lexing and parsing. In the lex/yacc
    world, lexing is specified using regular expressions, and parsing is
    specified using context-free grammars. These are concepts from
    formal languages; the lex/yacc tools constructing the machinery for
    you. For <literal>lex</literal>, this means constructing a finite
    automaton; and for <literal>yacc</literal>, this means constructing
    a pushdown automaton.
  </para>
  <para>
    Parsing is a broad and often intricate topic, and our purpose here
    is not to teach all of the ins and outs of yacc and lex, but to show
    how to use these tools in OCaml. There are online resources, and
    most experience you may have using lex/yacc in other languages will
    also apply in OCaml. However, there are differences, and we'll try
    to point out the larger ones here.
  </para>
  <para>
    For illustration, let's continue with the JSON example. For lexing,
    we'll use <literal>ocamllex</literal>, and for parsing, we'll use
    <literal>menhir</literal>, which is somewhat easier to use than
    <literal>ocamlyacc</literal>.

    <title>Defining a JSON parser with menhir</title>
    <para>
      The process of building a parser is interleaved between
      constructing the lexer and parser; you will have to do them
      simultaneously. The first step is to define the set of tokens that
      will be produced by the lexer. For various reasons, the tokens are
      specified by the parser (to specify what it expects as input), so
      we'll start with the parser first.
    </para>
    <para>
      A parser file has suffix <literal>.mly</literal> (we'll use the
      name <literal>parser.mly</literal>) and it contains several parts
      in the following sequence:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
  declarations
  %%
  rules
  %%
  optional OCaml code
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>%%</literal> are section separators; they have to be
      on a line by themselves. The declarations include token and type
      specifications, precedence directives, and other things, but we
      start by declaring the tokens.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="token-declarations">
      <title>Token declarations</title>

        A token is declared using the syntax

        <emphasis>uid</emphasis>, where the
        <literal>&lt;type&gt;</literal> is optional, and
        <emphasis>uid</emphasis> is an capitalized identifier. For JSON,
        we need tokens for numbers, strings, identifiers, and
        punctuation. To start, let's define just the tokens in the
        <literal>parser.mly</literal> file. For technical reasons, we
        need to include a <literal>%start</literal> declaration. For
        now, we'll include just a dummy grammer specification
        <literal>exp: { () }</literal> (we'll replace this when we

        The grammar itself is specified using a set of rules, where a
        rule contains a set of productions. Abstractly, a production
        looks like the following.

symbol: [ id1 = ] symbol1; [ id2 = ] symbol2; ...; [ idN = ] symbolN

        <literal>symbolN</literal>; the OCaml code computes a value for
        the target <literal>symbol</literal>. That's too abstract, so
        let's get down to defining productions for parsing JSON. Here is
        the main production for a JSON value.

        We can read it like this, &quot;A JSON <literal>value</literal>
        is either an object bracketed with curly braces, or an array
        bracketed with square braces. or a string, integer, float, etc.
        In each of the productions, the right hand side specfies the
        expected sequence. For example, the object is specified with the
        curly-bracket production.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
value: LEFT_BRACE; obj = opt_object_fields; RIGHT_BRACE
    { `Object obj }
</programlisting>
      <para>
        That is, an object value starts with a
        <literal>LEFT_BRACE</literal>, contains some optional object
        field values (to be defined), and end with a
        <literal>RIGHT_BRACE</literal>. The returned value is
        <literal>Object obj</literal>, where <literal>obj</literal> is
        the sequence of object fields. Note that we've left out bindings
        for <literal>LEFT_BRACE</literal> and
        <literal>RIGHT_BRACE</literal>, because their tokens don't have
        values.
      </para>
      <para>
        Next, let's define the object fields. In the following rules,
        the <literal>opt_object_fields</literal> are either empty, or a
        non-empty sequence of fields in reverse order. Note that if you
        wish to have comments in the rule definitions, you will have to
        use C comment delimiters. By convention, the C comment
        <literal>/* empty */</literal> is used to point out that a
        production has an empty right hand side.

    { (k, v) :: obj }
  ;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The rule <literal>rev_object_fields</literal> is defined
        recursively. It has either one key/value field, or it is a
        sequence of fields, followed by a <literal>COMMA</literal> and
        one more field definition.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>rev_</literal> prefixed is intended to point out
        that the fields are returned in reverse order. Why would we do
        that? One reason is that the <literal>menhir</literal> parser
        generator is left-recursive, which means that the constructed
        pushdown automoton uses less stack space with left-recursive
        definitions. The following right-recursive rule accepts the same
        input, but during parsing it requires linear stack space to read
        object field definitions.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
/* Inefficient right-recursive rule */
object_fields: k = ID; COLON; v = value
    { [k, v] }
  | k = ID; COLON; v = value; COMMA; obj = object_fields
    { (k, v) :: obj }
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Alternatively, we could keep the left-recursive definition and
        simply construct the returned value in left-to-right order. This
        is fine, though less efficient. You will have to choose you
        technique according to circumstances.

  ;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Finally, we can finish off the grammar by defining the rules for
        arrays, and adding a correct <literal>%start</literal>
        production. For the <literal>%start</literal> production, we'll
        return a <literal>value option</literal>, using

        The lexing rules are specified as a set of
        <literal>parse</literal> rules. A <literal>parse</literal> rule
        has a regular expression followed by OCaml code that defines a
        semantic action. Let's write JSON parse rule.

</programlisting>
      <para>
        The OCaml code for the rules has a parameter called
        <literal>lexbuf</literal> that defines the input, including the
        position in the input file, as well as the text that was matched
        by the regular expression. Let's skip to the third action.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
| int { INT (int_of_string (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf)) }
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This action specifies that when the input matches the
        <literal>int</literal> regular expression (defined as
        <literal>'-'? ['1'-'9'] ['0'-'9']*</literal>, then the lexer
        should return the expression
        <literal>INT (int_of_string (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf))</literal>.
        The expression <literal>Lexing.lexeme lexbuf</literal> returns
        the complete string matched by the regular expression. In this
        case, the string represents a number, so we use the
        <literal>int_of_string</literal> function to convert it to a
        number.
      </para>
      <para>
        Going back to the first actions, the first
        <literal>white { read lexbuf }</literal> calls the lexer
        recursively. That's, it skips the input whitespace and returns
        the following token. The action
        <literal>newline { next_line lexbuf; read lexbuf }</literal> is
        similar, but we use it to advance the line number for the lexer.
        Here is the definition of the <literal>next_line</literal>
        function, which updates the line number in the
        <literal>lexbuf</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
let next_line lexbuf =
  let pos = lexbuf.lex_curr_p in
  lexbuf.lex_curr_p &lt;-
    { pos with pos_bol = lexbuf.lex_curr_pos;
               pos_lnum = pos.pos_lnum + 1
    }
</programlisting>
      <para>
        There are actions for each different kind of token. The string
        expressions like <literal>&quot;true&quot; { TRUE }</literal>
        are used for keywords, and the special characters have actions
        too, like <literal>'{' { LEFT_BRACE }</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some of these patterns overlap. For example, the regular
        expression <literal>&quot;true&quot;</literal> is also matched
        by the <literal>id</literal> pattern.
        <literal>ocamllex</literal> used the following disambiguation
        when a prefix of the input is matched by more than one pattern.

          <para>
            The longest match always wins. For example, the first input
            <literal>trueX: 167</literal> matches the regular expression
            <literal>&quot;true&quot;</literal> for 4 characters, and it
            matches <literal>id</literal> for 5 characters. The longer
            match wins, and the return value is

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            If all matches have the same length, then the first action
            wins. If the input were <literal>true: 167</literal>, then
            both <literal>&quot;true&quot;</literal> and
            <literal>id</literal> match the first 4 characters;
            <literal>&quot;true&quot;</literal> is first, so the return

  <title>Data Serialization with S-Expressions</title>
  <para>
    We've already shown you how to parse third-party data formats into
    OCaml in earlier chapters. Sometimes though, you just want to
    quickly convert an OCaml type to and from a human-readable and
    editable form in your own code, and not worry about
    interoperability. Core's solution to this problem is to use
    s-expressions.
  </para>
  <para>
    S-expressions are nested paranthetical expressions whose atomic
    values are strings. They were first popularized by the Lisp
    programming language in the 1960s, and have remained one of the
    simplest and most effective ways to encode structured data. An
    example s-expression might look like this:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="scheme">
(this (is an) (s expression))
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The OCaml type of an s-expression is quite simple:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
module Sexp : sig
  type t = Atom of string | List of t list
end
</programlisting>
  <para>
    An s-expression can be thought of as a tree where each node contains
    a list of its children, and where the leaves of the tree are
    strings.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <literal>Sexp</literal> module in Core comes with functionality
    for parsing and printing s-expressions.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let sexp =
    let a x = Sexp.Atom x and l x = Sexp.List x in
    l [a &quot;this&quot;;l [a &quot;is&quot;; a &quot;an&quot;]; l [a &quot;s&quot;; a &quot;expression&quot;]];;
val sexp : Sexp.t = (this (is an) (s expression))
</programlisting>
  <para>
    In addition, most of the base types in Core support conversion to
    and from s-expressions. For example, we can write:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Int.sexp_of_t 3;;
- : Sexp.t = 3
# List.sexp_of_t;;
- : ('a -&gt; Sexp.t) -&gt; 'a List.t -&gt; Sexp.t = &lt;fun&gt;
# List.sexp_of_t Int.sexp_of_t [1;2;3];;
- : Sexp.t = (1 2 3)
</programlisting>
  <para>
    Notice that <literal>List.sexp_of_t</literal> is polymorphic, and
    takes as its first argument another conversion function to handle
    the elements of the list to be converted. Core uses this scheme more
    generally for defining sexp-converters for polymorphic types.
  </para>
  <para>
    But what if you want a function to convert some brand new type to an
    s-expression? You can of course write it yourself manually:
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type t = { foo: int; bar: float };;
# let sexp_of_t t =
    let a x = Sexp.Atom x and l x = Sexp.List x in
    l [ l [a &quot;foo&quot;; Int.sexp_of_t t.foo  ];
        l [a &quot;bar&quot;; Float.sexp_of_t t.bar]; ]
  ;;
val sexp_of_t : t -&gt; Core.Std.Sexp.t = &lt;fun&gt;
# sexp_of_t { foo = 3; bar = -5.5 };;
- : Core.Std.Sexp.t = ((foo 3) (bar -5.5))
</programlisting>
  <para>
    This is somewhat tiresome to write, and it gets more so when you
    consider the parser, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>,
    <literal>t_of_sexp</literal>, which is considerably more complex.
    Writing this kind of parsing and printing code by hand is mechanical
    and error prone, not to mention a drag.
  </para>
  <para>
    Given how mechanical the code is, you could imagine writing a
    program that inspected the type definition and auto-generated the
    conversion code for you. As it turns out, we can do just that using
    <literal>Sexplib</literal>. The <literal>Sexplib</literal> package,
    which is included with Core, provides both a library for
    manipulating s-exressions and a syntax extension for generating such
    conversion functions. With that synax extension enabled, any type
    that has <literal>with sexp</literal> as an annotation will trigger
    the generation of the functions we want for free.
  </para>
  <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type t = { foo: int; bar: float } with sexp;;
type t = { foo : int; bar : float; }
val t_of_sexp__ : Sexplib.Sexp.t -&gt; t = &lt;fun&gt;
val t_of_sexp : Sexplib.Sexp.t -&gt; t = &lt;fun&gt;
val sexp_of_t : t -&gt; Sexplib.Sexp.t = &lt;fun&gt;
# t_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string &quot;((bar 35) (foo 3))&quot;);;
- : t = {foo = 3; bar = 35.}
</programlisting>
  <para>
    The <literal>with sexp</literal> is detected by a
    <literal>Sexplib</literal> syntax extension and replaced with the
    extra conversion functions you see above. You can ignore
    <literal>t_of_sexp__</literal>, which is a helper function that is
    needed in very rare cases.
  </para>
  <para>
    The syntax extensions in Core almost all have this same basic
    structure: they auto-generate code based on type definitions,
    implementing functionality that you could in theory have implemented
    by hand, but with far less programmer effort.
  </para>
  <note>
  <title>
  The <literal>camlp4</literal> preprocessor and
  <literal>type_conv</literal>
  </title>
  <para>
    OCaml doesn't directly support converting static type definitions to
    and from other data formats. Instead, it supplies a powerful syntax
    extension mechanism known as <literal>camlp4</literal>. This lets
    you extend the grammar of the language to mark types as requiring
    special action, and then mechanically generate boilerplate code over
    those types (such as converting to and from other data formats).
  </para>
  <para>
    Many of the examples in the subsequent chapters depend on
    <literal>camlp4</literal>, but the examples all invoke it
    automatically for you via the <literal>-pp</literal> flag to the
    OCaml compiler. If you're interested in building your own
    generators, investigate the <literal>type_conv</literal> library
    which provides the basic extension mechanism used by the rest of
    this chapter.

  <sect1 id="the-sexp-format">
    <title>The Sexp format</title>
    <para>
      The textual representation of s-expressions is pretty
      straightforward. An s-expression is written down as a nested
      parenthetical expression, with whitespace-separated strings as the
      atoms. Quotes are used for atoms that contain parenthesis or
      spaces themselves; backslash is the escape character; and
      semicolons are used to introduce single-line comments. Thus, the
      following file, <literal>example.scm</literal>:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="scheme">
;; example.scm

((foo 3.3) ;; This is a comment
 (bar &quot;this is () an \&quot; atom&quot;))
</programlisting>
    <para>
      can be loaded using sexplib. As you can see, the commented data is
      not part of the resulting s-expression.

      <listitem>
        <para>

      <listitem>

        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

      Note that the comments were dropped from the file upon reading.
      This is expected, since there's no place in the
      <literal>Sexp.t</literal> type to store comments.
    </para>
    <para>
      If we introduce an error into our s-expression, by, say, deleting
      the open-paren in front of <literal>bar</literal>, we'll get a

    <title>Sexp converters</title>
    <para>
      The most important functionality provided by Sexplib is the
      auto-generation of converters for new types. We've seen a bit of
      how this works already, but let's walk through a complete example.
      Here's the source for the beginning of a library for representing
      integer intervals.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* file: int_interval.ml *)
(* Module for representing closed integer intervals *)

open Core.Std

(* Invariant: For any Range (x,y), y &gt;= x *)
type t = | Range of int * int
         | Empty
with sexp

let is_empty = function Empty -&gt; true | Range _ -&gt; false
let create x y = if x &gt; y then Empty else Range (x,y)
let contains i x = match i with
   | Empty -&gt; false
   | Range (low,high) -&gt; x &gt;= low &amp;&amp; x &lt;= high
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can now use this module as follows:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* file: test_interval.ml *)

open Core.Std

let intervals =
  let module I = Int_interval in
  [ I.create 3 4;
    I.create 5 4; (* should be empty *)
    I.create 2 3;
    I.create 1 6;
  ]

let () =
  intervals
  |&gt; List.sexp_of_t Int_interval.sexp_of_t
  |&gt; Sexp.to_string_hum
  |&gt; print_endline
</programlisting>
    <para>
      But we're still missing something: we haven't created an
      <literal>mli</literal> signature for
      <literal>Int_interval</literal> yet. Note that we need to
      explicitly export the s-expression converters that were created
      within the ml. If we don't:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* file: int_interval.mli *)
(* Module for representing closed integer intervals *)

type t

val is_empty : t -&gt; bool
val create : int -&gt; int -&gt; t
val contains : t -&gt; int -&gt; bool
</programlisting>
    <para>
      then we'll get the following error:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
File &quot;test_interval.ml&quot;, line 15, characters 20-42:
Error: Unbound value Int_interval.sexp_of_t

</programlisting>
    <para>
      We could export the types by hand in the signature:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
type t
val sexp_of_t : Sexp.t -&gt; t
val t_of_sexp : t -&gt; Sexp.t
</programlisting>
    <para>
      But Sexplib has a shorthand for this as well, so that we can just
      use the same <literal>with</literal> shorthand in the
      <literal>mli</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
type t with sexp
</programlisting>
    <para>
      at which point <literal>test_interval.ml</literal> will compile
      again, and if we run it, we'll get the following output:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ ./test_interval.native

</programlisting>
    <sect2 id="preserving-invariants">
      <title>Preserving invariants</title>
      <para>
        One easy mistake to make when dealing with sexp converters is to
        ignore the fact that those converters can violate the invariants
        of your code. For example, the <literal>Int_interval</literal>
        module depends for the correctness of the
        <literal>is_empty</literal> check on the fact that for any value
        <literal>Range (x,y)</literal>, <literal>y</literal> is greater
        than or equal to <literal>x</literal>. The
        <literal>create</literal> function preserves this invariant, but
        the <literal>t_of_sexp</literal> function does not.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can fix this problem by overriding the autogenerated function
        and writing a custom sexp-converter that is based on the
        auto-generated converter.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
type t = | Range of int * int
         | Empty

let create x y = if x &gt; y then Empty else Range (x,y)

  let t = t_of_sexp sexp in
  begin match t with

</programlisting>
      <para>
        This trick of overriding an existing function definition with a
        new one is perfectly acceptable in OCaml. Function definitions
        are only recursive if the <literal>rec</literal> keyword is
        specified, and so in this case the inner
        <literal>t_of_sexp</literal> call will go to the earlier
        auto-generated definition that resulted from the
        <literal>type t with sexp</literal> definition.
      </para>
      <para>
        We call the function <literal>of_sexp_error</literal> to raise
        an exception because that improves the error reporting that
        Sexplib can provide when a conversion fails.

      <title>Getting good error messages</title>
      <para>
        There are two steps to deserializing a type from an
        s-expression: first, converting the bytes in a file to an
        s-expression, and the second, converting that s-expression into
        the type in question. One problem with this is that it can be
        hard to localize errors to the right place using this scheme.
        Consider the following example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* file: read_foo.ml *)

open Core.Std

type t = { a: string; b: int; c: float option } with sexp

let run () =
  let t =
    Sexp.load_sexp &quot;example.scm&quot;
    |&gt; t_of_sexp
  in
  printf &quot;b is: %d\n%!&quot; t.b

let () =
  Exn.handle_uncaught ~exit:true run
</programlisting>
      <para>
        If you were to run this on a malformatted file, say, this one:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
;; example.scm
((a not-an-integer)
 (b not-an-integer)
 (c ()))
</programlisting>
      <para>
        you'll get the following error:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
read_foo $ ./read_foo.native
Uncaught exception:

  (Sexplib.Conv.Of_sexp_error
   (Failure &quot;int_of_sexp: (Failure int_of_string)&quot;) not-an-integer)
</programlisting>
      <para>
        If all you have is the error message and the string, it's not
        terribly informative. In particular, you know that the parsing
        error-ed out on the atom &quot;not-an-integer&quot;, but you
        don't know which one! In a large file, this kind of bad error
        message can be pure misery.
      </para>
      <para>
        But there's hope! If we make small change to the
        <literal>run</literal> function as follows:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
let run () =
  let t = Sexp.load_sexp_conv_exn &quot;example.scm&quot; t_of_sexp in
  printf &quot;b is: %d\n%!&quot; t.b
</programlisting>
      <para>
        and run it again, we'll get the following much more helpful
        error message:

  <sect1 id="sexp-conversion-directives">
    <title>Sexp-conversion directives</title>
    <para>
      Sexplib supports a collection of directives for modifying the
      default behavior of the auto-generated sexp-converters. These
      directives allow you to customize the way in which types are
      represented as s-expressions without having to write a custom
      parser.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="sexp_opaque">
      <title><literal>sexp_opaque</literal></title>
      <para>
        The most commonly used directive is
        <literal>sexp_opaque</literal>, whose purpose is to mark a given
        component of a type as being unconvertible. Anything marked with
        <literal>sexp_opaque</literal> will be presented as the atom
        <literal>&lt;opaque&gt;</literal> by the to-sexp converter, and
        will trigger an exception from the from-sexp converter. Note
        that the type of a component marked as opaque doesn't need to
        have a sexp-converter defined. Here, if we define a type without
        a sexp-converter, and then try to use it another type with a
        sexp-converter, we'll error out:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type no_converter = int * int;;
type no_converter = int * int
# type t = { a: no_converter; b: string } with sexp;;
Characters 14-26:
  type t = { a: no_converter; b: string } with sexp;;
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: Unbound value no_converter_of_sexp
</programlisting>
      <para>
        But with <literal>sexp_opaque</literal>, we won't:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type t = { a: no_converter sexp_opaque; b: string } with sexp;;
type t = { a : no_converter Core.Std.sexp_opaque; b : string; }
val t_of_sexp__ : Sexplib.Sexp.t -&gt; t = &lt;fun&gt;
val t_of_sexp : Sexplib.Sexp.t -&gt; t = &lt;fun&gt;
val sexp_of_t : t -&gt; Sexplib.Sexp.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        And if we now convert a value of this type to an s-expression,
        we'll see the contents of field <literal>a</literal> marked as
        opaque:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# sexp_of_t { a = (3,4); b = &quot;foo&quot; };;

    <sect2 id="sexp_list">
      <title><literal>sexp_list</literal></title>
      <para>
        Sometimes, sexp-converters have more parentheses than one would
        ideally like. Consider, for example, the following variant type:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type compatible_versions = | Specific of string list
                             | All

- : Sexp.t = (Specific (3.12.0 3.12.1 3.13.0))
</programlisting>
      <para>
        You might prefer to make the syntax a bit less parenthesis-laden
        by dropping the parentheses around the list.
        <literal>sexp_list</literal> gives us this alternate syntax:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type compatible_versions = | Specific of string sexp_list
                             | All

    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="sexp_option">
      <title><literal>sexp_option</literal></title>
      <para>
        Another common directive is <literal>sexp_option</literal>,
        which is used to to make a record field optional in the
        s-expressoin. Normally, optional values are represented either
        as <literal>()</literal> for <literal>None</literal>, or as
        <literal>(x)</literal> for <literal>Some x</literal>, and a
        record field containing an option would be rendered accordingly.
        For example:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type t = { a: int option; b: string } with sexp;;
# sexp_of_t { a = None; b = &quot;hello&quot; };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a ()) (b hello))
# sexp_of_t { a = Some 3; b = &quot;hello&quot; };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a (3)) (b hello))
</programlisting>
      <para>
        But what if we want a field to be optional,
        <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, we want to allow it to be omitted
        from the record entirely? In that case, we can mark it with
        <literal>sexp_option</literal>:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type t = { a: int sexp_option; b: string } with sexp;;
# sexp_of_t { a = Some 3; b = &quot;hello&quot; };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a 3) (b hello))
# sexp_of_t { a = None; b = &quot;hello&quot; };;

    <sect2 id="specifying-defaults">
      <title>Specifying defaults</title>
      <para>
        The <literal>sexp_option</literal> declaration is really just an
        example of how one might want to deal with default values. With
        <literal>sexp_option</literal>, your type on the OCaml side is
        an option, with <literal>None</literal> representing the case
        where no value is provided. But you might want to allow other
        ways of filling in default values.
      </para>
      <para>
        Consider the following type which represents the configuration
        of a very simple web-server.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

</programlisting>
      <para>
        One could imagine making some of these paramters optional; in
        particular, by default, we might want the web server to bind to
        port 80, and to listen as localhost. The sexp-syntax allows this
        to do this, as follows.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# type http_server_config = {
     web_root: string;

        As you can see, the fields that are at their default values are

        This can be very useful in designing config file formats that
        are both reasonably terse and easy to generate and maintain. It
        can also be useful for backwards compatibility: if you add a new
        field to your config record, but you make that field optiona,
        then you should still be able to parse older version of your
        config.

  <title>Concurrent Programming with Async</title>
  <para>
    The logic of building programs that interact with the outside world
    is often dominated by waiting: waiting for the click of a mouse, or
    for data to be fetched from disk, or for space to be available on an
    outgoing network buffer. Even mildly sophisticated interactive
    applications are typically <emphasis>concurrent</emphasis>, needing
    to wait for multiple different events at the same time, responding
    immediately to whatever event happens first.
  </para>
  <para>
    A common approach to concurrency is to use preemptive system
    threads, which is the most common solution in languages like Java or
    C#. In this model, each task that may require simultaneous waiting
    is given an operating system thread of its own, so it can block
    without stopping the entire program. Other language runtimes such as
    Javascript are single-threaded, and applications register function
    callbacks to be triggered upon external events such as a timeout or
    browser click.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each of these mechanisms has its own trade-offs. Preemptive threads
    require significant memory and other resources per thread. Also, the
    operating system can arbitrarily interleave the execution of
    preemptive threads, requiring the programmer to carefully protect
    shared resources with locks and condition variables, which can be
    exceedingly error-prone.
  </para>
  <para>
    Single-threaded event-driven systems, on the other hand, execute a
    single task at a time and do not require the same kind of complex
    synchronization that preemptive threads do. However, the inverted
    control structure of an event-driven program often means that your
    own control flow has to be threaded awkwardly through the system's
    event loop, leading to a maze of event callbacks.
  </para>
  <para>
    This chapter covers the Async library, which offers a hybrid model
    that aims to provide the best of both worlds, avoiding the
    performance compromises and synchronization woes of preemptive
    threads without the confusing inversion of control that usually
    comes with event-driven systems.
  </para>

    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# In_channel.read_all;;
- : string -&gt; string = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Since the function returns a concrete string, it has to block
      until the read completes. The blocking nature of the call means
      that no progress can be made on anything else until the read is
      completed, as you can see below.
    </para>

    <para>
      In Async, well-behaved functions never block. Instead, they return
      a value of type <literal>Deferred.t</literal> that acts as a
      placeholder that will eventually be filled in with the result. As
      an example, consider the signature of the Async equivalent of
      <literal>In_channel.read_all</literal>.
    </para>

</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that we opened <literal>Async.Std</literal>, which adds a
      number of new identifiers and modules into our environment that
      make using Async more convenient. Opening
      <literal>Async.Std</literal> is standard practice for writing
      programs using Async, much like opening

    <para>
      A deferred is essentially a handle to a value that may be computed
      in the future. As such, if we call
      <literal>Reader.file_contents</literal>, the resulting deferred
      will initially be empty, as you can see by calling
      <literal>Deferred.peek</literal> on the resulting deferred.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let contents = Reader.file_contents &quot;test.txt&quot;;;
val contents : string Deferred.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# Deferred.peek contents;;
- : string option = None
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The value in <literal>contents</literal> isn't yet determined in
      part because there's nothing running that could do the necessary
      I/O. When using Async, processing of I/O and other events is
      handled by the Async scheduler. When writing a stand-along
      program, you need to start the scheduler explicitly, but utop
      knows about Async, and can start the scheduler automatically. More
      than that, utop knows about deferred values, and when you type in
      an expression of type <literal>Deferred.t</literal>, it will make
      sure the scheduler is running and block until the deferred is
      determined. Thus, we can write:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# contents;;
- : string = &quot;This is only a test.\n&quot;
# Deferred.peek contents;;
- : string option = Some &quot;This is only a test.\n&quot;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In order to do real work with deferreds, we need a way of
      sequencing deferred computations, which we do using
      <literal>Deferred.bind</literal>. First, let's consider the
      type-signature of bind.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Deferred.bind ;;
- : 'a Deferred.t -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b Deferred.t) -&gt; 'b Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Thus, <literal>Deferred.bind d f</literal> takes a deferred value
      <literal>d</literal> and a function f that is to be run with value
      of <literal>d</literal> once it's determined. The call to
      <literal>Deferred.bind</literal> returns a new deferred that
      becomes determined when the deferred returned by
      <literal>f</literal> is determined. It also implicitly registers
      with the scheduler an <emphasis>Async job</emphasis> that is
      responsible for running <literal>f</literal> once
      <literal>d</literal> is determined.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's a simple use of bind for a function that replaces a file
      with an uppercase version of its contents.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let uppercase_file filename =
    let text = Reader.file_contents filename in
    Deferred.bind text (fun text -&gt;
      Writer.save filename ~contents:(String.uppercase text))
  ;;
val uppercase_file : string -&gt; unit Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;
# uppercase_file &quot;test.txt&quot;;;
- : unit = ()
# Reader.file_contents &quot;test.txt&quot;;;
- : string = &quot;THIS IS ONLY A TEST.&quot;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Writing out <literal>Deferred.bind</literal> explicitly can be
      rather verbose, and so <literal>Async.Std</literal> includes an
      infix operator for it: <literal>&gt;&gt;=</literal>. Using this
      operator, we can rewrite <literal>uppercase_file</literal> as
      follows.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let uppercase_file filename =
    Reader.file_contents filename &gt;&gt;= fun text -&gt;
    Writer.save filename ~contents:(String.uppercase text)
  ;;
val uppercase_file : string -&gt; unit Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In the above we've dropped the parenthesis around the function on
      the right-hand side of the bind, and we've didn't add a level of
      indentation for the contents of that function. This is standard
      practice for using the bind operator.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now let's look at another potential use of bind. In this case,
      we'll write a function that counts the number of lines in a file.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let count_lines filename =
    Reader.file_contents filename &gt;&gt;= fun text -&gt;
    List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n');;
  ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This looks reasonable enough, but when we try to compile it, we
      get the following error.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
         'a Deferred.t
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The issue here is that bind expects a function that returns a
      deferred, but we've provided it a function that simply returns the
      result. To make these signatures match, we need a function for
      taking an ordinary value and wrapping it in a deferred. This
      function is a standard part of Async, and is called
      <literal>return</literal>:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
# return;;
- : 'a -&gt; 'a Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;
# let three = return 3;;
val three : int Deferred.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# three;;
- : int = 3
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Using <literal>return</literal>, we can make
      <literal>count_lines</literal> compile.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let count_lines filename =
    Reader.file_contents filename &gt;&gt;= fun text -&gt;
    return (List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n'));;
  ;;
val count_lines : string -&gt; int Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Together, <literal>bind</literal> and <literal>return</literal>
      form a design pattern in functional programming known as a
      <emphasis>monad</emphasis>. You'll run across this signature in
      many applications beyond just threads. Indeed, we already ran
      across monads in
      <xref linkend="bind-and-other-error-handling-idioms"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Calling <literal>bind</literal> and <literal>return</literal>
      together is a fairly common pattern, and as such there is a
      standard shortcut for it called <literal>Deferred.map</literal>,
      which has the following signature:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Deferred.map;;
- : 'a Deferred.t -&gt; f:('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      and comes with its own infix equivalent,
      <literal>&gt;&gt;|</literal>. Using it, we can rewrite
      <literal>count_lines</literal> again a bit more succinctly:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let count_lines filename =
    Reader.file_contents filename &gt;&gt;| fun text -&gt;
    List.length (String.split text ~on:'\n');;
  ;;
val count_lines : string -&gt; int Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;

      <para>
        Deferreds are usually built using combinations of
        <literal>bind</literal>, <literal>map</literal> and
        <literal>return</literal>, but sometimes you want to construct a
        deferred that you can determine explicitly with user-code. This
        is done using an <emphasis>ivar</emphasis>, which is a handle
        that lets you control precisely when a deferred becomes
        determined.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are three fundamental operations for working with an ivar;
        you can create one, using <literal>Ivar.create</literal>, you
        can read off the deferred that corresponds to the ivar in
        question, using <literal>Ivar.read</literal>, and you can fill
        an ivar, thus causing that deferred to become determined, using
        <literal>Ivar.fill</literal>. These operations are illustrated
        below.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let ivar = Ivar.create ();;
val ivar : '_a Ivar.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# let def = Ivar.read ivar;;

</programlisting>
      <para>
        Ivars are something of a low-level feature; operators like map,
        bind and return are typically easier to use and think about. But
        ivars can be useful when you want to build complicated
        synchronization patterns that can't be constructed naturally
        otherwise.
      </para>
      <para>
        As an example, imagine we wanted a way of scheduling a sequence
        of actions that would run after a fixed delay. In addition, we'd
        like to guarantee that these delayed actions are executed in the
        same order they were scheduled in. One could imagine building a
        module for handling this with the following interface.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module type Delayer_intf = sig
    type t
    val create : Time.Span.t -&gt; t
    val schedule : t -&gt; (unit -&gt; 'a Deferred.t) -&gt; 'a Deferred.t
  end;;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        An action is handed to <literal>schedule</literal> in the form
        of a deferred-returning thunk (a thunk is a function whose
        argument is of type <literal>unit</literal>). A deferred is
        handed back to the caller of <literal>schedule</literal> that
        will eventually be filled with the contents of the deferred
        value returned by the thunk to be scheduled. We can implement
        this using an <literal>ivar</literal> which we fill after the
        thunk is called and the deferred it returns becomes determined.
        Instead of using <literal>bind</literal> or
        <literal>map</literal> for scheduling these events, we'll use a
        different operator called <literal>upon</literal>. Here's the
        signature of <literal>upon</literal>:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# upon;;
- : 'a Deferred.t -&gt; ('a -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Like <literal>bind</literal> and <literal>return</literal>,
        <literal>upon</literal> schedules a callback to be executed when
        the deferred it is passed is determined; but unlike those calls,
        it doesn't create a new deferred for this callback to fill.
      </para>
      <para>
        Our delayer implementation is organized around a queue of
        thunks, where every call to <literal>schedule</literal> adds a
        thunk to the queue, and also schedules a job in the future to
        grab a thunk off the queue and run it. The waiting will be done
        using the function <literal>after</literal> which takes a time
        span and returns a deferred which becomes determined after that
        time span elapses. The role of the <literal>ivar</literal> here
        is to take the value returned by the thunk and use it to fill
        the deferred returned by the provided thunk.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module Delayer : Delayer_intf = struct
    type t = { delay: Time.Span.t;

        This code isn't particularly long, but it is a bit subtle. This
        is typical of code that involves ivars and
        <literal>upon</literal>, and because of this, you should stick
        to the simpler map/bind/return style of working with deferreds

    <title>Examples: an echo server</title>
    <para>
      Now that we have the basics of Async under our belt, let's look at
      a small complete stand-alone Async program. In particular, we'll
      write an echo server, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, a program that
      accepts connections from clients and spits back every line of text
      sent to it.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first step is to create a function that can copy data from an
      input to an output. Here, we'll use Async's
      <literal>Reader</literal> and <literal>Writer</literal> modules
      which provide a convenient abstraction for working with input and
      output channels.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* filename: echo.ml *)
open Core.Std
open Async.Std

(* Copy data from the reader to the writer, using the provided buffer
   as scratch space *)
let rec copy_blocks buffer r w =
  Reader.read r buffer
  &gt;&gt;= function
  | `Eof -&gt; return ()
  | `Ok bytes_read -&gt;
    Writer.write w buffer ~len:bytes_read;
    Writer.flushed w
    &gt;&gt;= fun () -&gt;
    copy_blocks buffer r w
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Bind is used in the above code to sequence the operations: first,
      we call <literal>Reader.read</literal> to get a block of input,
      then, when that's complete and if a new block was returned, we
      write that block to the writer. Finally, we wait until the
      writer's buffers are flushed, waiting on the deferred returned by
      <literal>Writer.flushed</literal>, at which point we recur. If we
      hit an end-of-file condition, the loop is ended. The deferred
      returned by a call to <literal>copy_blocks</literal> becomes
      determined only once the end-of-file condition is hit.
    </para>
    <para>
      One important aspect of how this is written is that it uses
      <emphasis>pushback</emphasis>, which is to say that if the writer
      can't make progress writing, the reader will stop reading. If you
      don't implement pushback in your servers, then a stopped client
      can cause your program to leak memory, since you'll need to
      allocate space for the data that's been read in but not yet
      written out.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>copy_blocks</literal> provides the logic for handling a
      client connection, but we still need to set up a server to receive
      such connections and dispatch to <literal>copy_blocks</literal>.
      For this, we'll use Async's <literal>Tcp</literal> module, which
      has a collection of utilities for creating simple TCP clients and
      servers.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(** Starts a TCP server, which listens on the specified port, invoking
    copy_lines every time a client connects. *)
let run () =
  let buffer = String.create (16 * 1024) in

    Tcp.Server.create
      ~on_handler_error:`Raise

  ignore (host_and_port : (Socket.Address.Inet.t, int) Tcp.Server.t Deferred.t)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The result of calling <literal>Tcp.Server.create</literal> is a
      <literal>Tcp.Server.t</literal>, which is a handle to the server
      that lets you shut the server down. We don't use that
      functionality here, so we explicitly ignore [server] to suppress
      the unused-variables error. We put in a type annotation around the
      ignored value to make the nature of the value we're ignoring
      explicit.
    </para>
    <para>
      The most important argument to
      <literal>Tcp.Server.create</literal> is the final one, which is
      the client connection handler. Notably, the above code does
      nothing explicit to close down the client connections when the
      communication is done. That's because the server will
      automatically shut down the connection once the deferred returned
      by the handler becomes determined.
    </para>
    <para>
      Finally, we need to initiate the server and start the Async
      scheduler.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
(* Call [run], and then start the scheduler *)
let () =
  run ();
  never_returns (Scheduler.go ())
</programlisting>
    <para>
      One of the most common newbie errors with Async is to forget to
      run the scheduler. It can be a bewildering mistake, because
      without the scheduler, your program won't do anything at all; even
      calls to <literal>printf</literal> won't actually reach the
      terminal.
    </para>
    <para>
      It's worth noting that even though we didn't spend much explicit
      effort on thinking about multiple clients, this server is able to
      handle many concurrent clients without further modification.

    Functions that never return
    </title>
    <para>
      You might wonder what's going on with the call to
      <literal>never_returns</literal> above.
      <literal>never_returns</literal> is an idiom that comes from
      <literal>Core</literal> that is used to mark functions that don't
      return. Typically, a function that doesn't return is inferred as
      having return type <literal>'a</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec loop_forever () = loop_forever ();;
val loop_forever : unit -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
# let always_fail () = assert false;;
val always_fail : unit -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This can be surprising when you call a function like this
      expecting it to return unit, and really it never returns. The
      type-checker won't necessarily complain in such a case.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let do_stuff n =
    let x = 3 in
    if n &gt; 0 then loop_forever ();
    x + n
  ;;
val do_stuff : int -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      With a name like <literal>loop_forever</literal>, the meaning is
      clear enough in this case. But with something like
      <literal>Scheduler.go</literal>, the fact that it never returns is
      less clear, and so we use the type-system to make it more explicit
      by giving it a return type of <literal>never_returns</literal>. To
      make it clearer how this works, let's do the same trick with
      <literal>loop_forever</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let rec loop_forever () : never_returns = loop_forever ();;
val loop_forever : unit -&gt; never_returns = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The type <literal>never_returns</literal> is uninhabited, so a
      function can't return a value of type
      <literal>never_returns</literal>, which means only functions that
      never return can have it as their return type! Now, if we rewrite
      our <literal>do_stuff</literal> function, we'll get a helpful type
      error.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let do_stuff n =
    let x = 3 in
    if n &gt; 0 then loop_forever ();
    x + n
  ;;
Error: This expression has type unit but an expression was expected of type
         never_returns
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can resolve the error by calling the function
      <literal>never_returns</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# never_returns;;
- : never_returns -&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;
# let do_stuff n =
    let x = 3 in
    if n &gt; 0 then never_returns (loop_forever ());
    x + n
  ;;
val do_stuff : int -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Thus, we got the compilation to go through by explicitly marking
      in the source that the call to <literal>loop_forever</literal>
      never returns.

        <literal>Pipe</literal>. A <literal>Pipe</literal> is a
        communication channel that's used for connecting different parts
        of your program. You can think of it as a consumer/producer
        queue that uses deferreds for communicating when the pipe is
        ready to be read from or written to. Our use of pipes is fairly
        minimal here, but they are an important part of Async, so it's
        worth discussing them in some detail.
      </para>
      <para>
        Pipes are created in connected read/write pairs, as you can see
        below.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (r,w) = Pipe.create ();;
val r : '_a Pipe.Reader.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
val w : '_a Pipe.Writer.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        <literal>r</literal> and <literal>w</literal> are really just
        read and write handles to the same underlying object. Note that
        <literal>r</literal> and <literal>w</literal> have weakly
        polymorphic types. That's because a pipe is mutable and so can
        contain elements of only one type, which will be settled by the
        compiler once we try to use the pipe for anything.
      </para>
      <para>
        If we just try and write to the writer, we'll see that we block
        indefinitely in utop. You can break out of the wait by hitting
        <literal>Control-C</literal>.
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Pipe.write w &quot;Hello World!&quot;;;
Interrupted.
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The deferred returned by write completes on its own once the
        value written into the pipe has been read out:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let (r,w) = Pipe.create ();;
val r : '_a Pipe.Reader.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
val w : '_a Pipe.Writer.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# let write_complete = Pipe.write w &quot;Hello World!&quot;;;
val write_complete : unit Deferred.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# Pipe.read r;;
- : [ `Eof | `Ok of string ] = `Ok &quot;Hello World!&quot;
# write_complete;;
- : unit = ()
</programlisting>
      <para>
        In the function <literal>run</literal> above, we're taking
        advantage of one of the many utility functions provided for
        pipes in the <literal>Pipe</literal> module. In particular,
        we're using <literal>Pipe.transfer</literal> to set up a process
        that takes data from a reader-pipe and moves it to a
        writer-pipe. Here's the type of
        <literal>Pipe.transfer</literal>:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Pipe.transfer;;
- : 'a Pipe.Reader.t -&gt; 'b Pipe.Writer.t -&gt; f:('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; unit Deferred.t =
&lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The two pipes being connected are generated by the
        <literal>Reader.pipe</literal> and
        <literal>Writer.pipe</literal> call respectively. Note that
        pushback is preserved throughout the process, so that if the
        writer gets blocked, the the writer's pipe will stop pulling
        data from the reader's pipe, which will prevent the reader from
        reading in more data.
      </para>
      <para>
        Importantly, the deferred returned by
        <literal>Pipe.transfer</literal> becomes determined once the
        reader has been closed and the last element is transferred from
        the reader to the writer. Once that deferred becomes determined,
        the server will shut down that client connection. So, when a
        client disconnects, the rest of the shutdown happens
        transparently.
      </para>
      <para>
        The command-line parsing for this program is based on the
        <literal>Command</literal> library that we introduced in
        <xref linkend="command-line-parsing"/>. When you open
        <literal>Async.Std</literal>, the <literal>Command</literal>
        module has added to it the <literal>async_basic</literal> call:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Command.async_basic;;
- : summary:string -&gt;
    ?readme:(unit -&gt; string) -&gt;
    ('a, unit -&gt; unit Deferred.t) Command.Spec.t -&gt; 'a -&gt; Command.t
= &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This differs from the ordinary <literal>Command.basic</literal>
        call in that the main function must return a
        <literal>Deferred.t</literal>, and that the running of the
        command (using <literal>Command.run</literal>) automatically
        starts the async scheduler, without requiring an explicit call
        to <literal>Scheduler.go</literal>.

        You're probably familiar with HTTP URLs, which identify
        endpoints across the World Wide Web. These are actually part of
        a more general family known as Uniform Resource Identifiers
        (URIs). The full URI specification is defined in
        <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC3986</ulink>,
        and is rather complicated. Luckily, the <literal>uri</literal>

        much of the hassle.

        We expect the response from DuckDuckGo to come across as a JSON

        To better understand what's going on, it's useful to look at the

        pipe reader to which the body of the request will be written to
        as it is received.
      </para>
      <para>
        In this case, the HTTP body probably isn't very large, so we
        call <literal>Pipe.to_list</literal> to collect the strings from
        the pipe as a single deferred list of strings. We then join
        those strings using <literal>String.concat</literal> and pass
        the result through our parsing function.

      <para>
        Running a single search isn't that interesting from a
        concurrency perspective, so let's write code for dispatching

        does: the version of <literal>printf</literal> that's called
        here is actually Async's specialized <literal>printf</literal>
        that goes through the Async scheduler rather than printing
        directly. The original definition of <literal>printf</literal>
        is shadowed by this ne one when you open
        <literal>Async.Std</literal>. An important side effect of this
        is that if you write an Async program and forget to start the
        scheduler, calls like <literal>printf</literal> won't actually
        generate any output!

      <para>
        Note that the list returned by <literal>Deferred.all</literal>
        reflects the order of the deferreds passed to it. As such, the
        definitions will be printed out in the same order that the
        search wrods are passed in, no matter what orders the queries
        return in. We could rewrite this code to print out the results
        as they're received (and thus potentially out of order) as

        printing them out together. We use

    <title>Exception handling</title>
    <para>
      When programming with external resources, errors are everywhere:
      everything from a flaky server to a network outage to exhausting
      of local resources can lead to a run-time error. When programming
      in OCaml, some of these errors will show up explicitly in a
      function's return type, and of them will show up as exceptions. We
      covered exception handling in OCaml in
      <xref linkend="exceptions"/>, but as we'll see,
      exception handling in a concurrent program presents some new
      challenges.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's get a better sense of how exceptions work in Async by
      creating an asynchronous computation that (sometimes) fails with
      an exception. The function <literal>maybe_raise</literal> below
      blocks for half a second, and then either throws an exception or
      returns unit, alternating between the two behaviors on subsequent
      calls.

      In utop, the exception thrown by <literal>maybe_raise ()</literal>

      entire process.
    </para>
    <para>
      So, how could we capture and handle such an exception? You might
      try to do this using OCaml's built-in <literal>try/with</literal>
      statement, but as you can see below, that doesn't quite do the
      trick.

    <para>
      This didn't work because <literal>try/with</literal> only captures
      exceptions that are thrown in the code directly executed within

      run in the future, and it's that job that throws an exception.

      <para>
        <literal>try_with</literal> is a a great way of handling
        exceptions in Async, but it's not the whole story. All of
        Async's exception-handling mechanisms,
        <literal>try_with</literal> included, are built on top of
        Async's system of <emphasis>monitors</emphasis>, which are
        inspired by the error-handling mechanism in Erlang of the same
        name. Monitors are fairly low-level and are only occasionally

        work.
      </para>
      <para>
        In Async, a monitor is a context that determines what to do when
        there is an unhandled exception. Every Async job runs within the
        context of some monitor, which, when the job is running, is
        referred to as the current monitor. When a new Async job is
        scheduled, say, using <literal>bind</literal> or

        job that spawned it.

        Monitors are arranged in a tree -- when a new monitor is created
        (say, using <literal>Monitor.create</literal>) it is a child of
        the current monitor. You can explicitly run jobs within a
        monitor using <literal>within</literal>, which takes a thunk
        that returns a non-deferred value, or
        <literal>within'</literal>, which takes a thunk that returns a
        deferred. Here's an example.

        In addition to the ordinary stack-trace, the exception displays
        the trace of monitors through which the exception traveled,
        starting at the one we created, called &quot;blow up
        monitor&quot;. The other monitors you see come from utop's
        special handling of deferreds.
      </para>
      <para>
        Monitors can do more than just augment the error-trace of an
        exception. You can also use a monitor to explicitly handle
        errors delivered to that monitor. The
        <literal>Monitor.errors</literal> call is a particularly
        important one. It detaches the monitor from its parent, handing
        back the stream of errors that would otherwise have been
        delivered to the parent monitor. This allows one to do custom
        handling of errors, which may include re-raising errors to the
        parent. Here is a very simple example of function that captures
        and ignores errors in the processes it spawns.

        The message &quot;an error happened&quot; is printed out, but

        In practice, you should rarely use monitors directly, instead
        using functions like <literal>try_with</literal> and
        <literal>Monitor.protect</literal> that are built on top of
        monitors. One example of a library that uses monitors directly
        is <literal>Tcp.Server.create</literal>, which tracks both
        exceptions thrown by the logic that handles the network
        connection and by the callback for responding to an individual
        request, in either case responding to an exception by closing
        the connection. It is for building this kind of custom error
        handling that monitors can be helpful.

        Let's now go back and improve the exception handling of our
        DuckDuckGo client. In particular, we'll change it so that any
        individual queries that fail are reported as such, without
        preventing other queries from succeeding.
      </para>
      <para>
        The search code as it is fails rarely, so let's make make a
        change that can cause it to fail more predictably, by making it
        possible to distribute the requests over multiple servers. Then,
        we'll handle the errors that occur when one of those servers is
        mis-specified.
      </para>
      <para>
        First we'll need to change <literal>query_uri</literal> to take
        an argument specifying the server to connect to, as follows.

      In a concurrent program, one often needs to combine results from
      multiple distinct concurrent sub-computations going on in the same
      program. We already saw this in our DuckDuckGo example, where we
      used <literal>Deferred.all</literal> and
      <literal>Deferred.all_unit</literal> to wait for a list of
      deferreds to become determined. Another useful primitive is
      <literal>Deferred.both</literal>, which lets you wait until two
      deferreds of different types have returned, returning both values
      as a tuple. Here, we use the function <literal>sec</literal>,
      which is shorthand for creating a time-span equal to a given
      number of seconds.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let string_and_float = Deferred.both
   (after (sec 0.5)  &gt;&gt;| fun () -&gt; &quot;A&quot;)

val string_and_float : (string * float) Deferred.t = &lt;abstr&gt;
# string_and_float;;
- : string * float = (&quot;A&quot;, 32.33)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Sometimes, however, we want to wait only for the first of multiple
      events to occur. This happens particularly often when dealing with
      timeouts. In that case, we can use the call
      <literal>Deferred.any</literal>, which, given a list of deferreds,
      returns a single deferred that will become determined once any of
      the values on the list is determined.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# Deferred.any [ (after (sec 0.5) &gt;&gt;| fun () -&gt; &quot;half a second&quot;)

    <para>
      Let's use this to add timeouts to our DuckDuckGo searches. We'll
      do this by writing a wrapper for <literal>get_definition</literal>
      that takes a timeout (in the form of a
      <literal>Time.Span.t</literal>) as an argument, and returns either
      the definition, or, if that takes too long, the timeout.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let get_definition_with_timeout ~server ~timeout word =
  Deferred.any
    [ (after timeout &gt;&gt;| fun () -&gt; (word,Error &quot;Timed out&quot;))

       let result' = match result with
         | Ok _ as x -&gt; x

    <para>
      We use <literal>&gt;&gt;|</literal> above to transform the
      deferred values we're waiting for so that
      <literal>Deferred.any</literal> can choose between values of the
      same type.
    </para>
    <para>
      A problem with this code is that the HTTP query kicked off by
      <literal>get_definition</literal> is not actually shut down when
      the timeout fires. As such,
      <literal>get_definition_with_timeout</literal> essentially leaks
      an open connection. Happily, Cohttp does provide a way of shutting
      down a client. You can pass a deferred under the label
      <literal>interrupt</literal> to
      <literal>Cohttp_async.Client.get</literal>. Once
      <literal>interrupt</literal> is determined, the client connection
      will terminated and the corresponding connections closed.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following code shows how you can change
      <literal>get_definition</literal> and
      <literal>get_definition_with_timeout</literal> to cancel the
      <literal>get</literal> call if the timeout expires.
    </para>

    <para>
      Next, we'll modify <literal>get_definition_with_timeout</literal>
      to create a deferred to pass in to
      <literal>get_definition</literal> which will become determined
      when our timeout expires.

</programlisting>
    <para>
      This will work, and will cause the connection to shut-down cleanly
      when we time out; but our code no longer explicitly knows whether
      or not the timeout has kicked in. In particular, the error message
      on a timeout will now be <literal>Unexpected failure</literal>
      rather than <literal>Timed out</literal>, which it was in our
      previous implementation. This is a minor issue in this case, but
      if we wanted to have special behavior in the case of a timeout, it
      would be a more serious issue.
    </para>
    <para>
      We can get more precise handling of timeouts using Async's
      <literal>choose</literal> operator, which lets you pick between a
      collection of different deferreds, reacting to exactly one of
      them. Each deferred is combined, using the function
      <literal>choice</literal>, with a function that is called if and
      only if that is the chosen deferred. Here's the type signature of
      <literal>choice</literal> and <literal>choose</literal>:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# choice;;
- : 'a Deferred.t -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'b Deferred.choice = &lt;fun&gt;
# choose;;
- : 'a Deferred.choice list -&gt; 'a Deferred.t = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      <literal>choose</literal> provides no guarantee that the
      <literal>choice</literal> built around the first deferred to
      become determined will in fact be chosen. But
      <literal>choose</literal> does guarantee that only one
      <literal>choice</literal> will be chosen, and only the chosen
      <literal>choice</literal> will execute the attached closure.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the following, we use <literal>choose</literal> to ensure that
      the <literal>interrupt</literal> deferred becomes determined if
      and only if the timeout-deferred is chosen. Here's the code.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
let get_definition_with_timeout ~server ~timeout word =
  let interrupt = Ivar.create () in

    [ choice (after timeout) (fun () -&gt;
       Ivar.fill interrupt ();

    Clients can either publish values under a topic, or subscribe to the
    stream of values associated with a given topic. The server will
    maintain a cache of the last value published under any given topic,
    so that a subscriber immediately receives the most recently
    published value under said topic. To make it easier to see what's
    going on, we'll also implement a query for dumping the current state
    of the server.

    We'll use Async's <literal>Rpc</literal> module for implementing

    we'll use. The <literal>Rpc</literal> module actually supports two

  <para>
    The <literal>bin_prot</literal> syntax extension isn't activated by
    default in the toplevel, but is easily available if you add this to
    your <literal>~/.ocamlinit</literal> file. You can also just type

  <para>
    The extension is activated by putting <literal>with bin_io</literal>
    after the type declaration. This looks a bit unsightly in the
    toplevel because of all the definitions that are generated. We'll
    elide those definitions in the book, but you can see them for
    yourself in the toplevel.

      Here's a small complete example of a program that can read and
      write values using <literal>bin_io</literal>. Here, the
      serialization is of types that might be used as part of a
      message-queue, where each message has a topic, some content, and a
      source, which is in turn a hostname and a port.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

      You can can combine multiple syntax generators in the same type

    </para>
    <para>
      Next we need to define how to marshal and unmarshal these
      messages. The interface is a little more complex than for
      s-expressions since we don't just want to serialise from the
      normal OCaml <literal>string</literal>, but also to the
      <literal>bigstring</literal> type. We'll explain what this is in
      more detail shortly, but for now think of it as a more efficient
      alternative for large binary data.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <literal>binable</literal> value above captures all the
      auto-generated <literal>bin_io</literal> functions into a

      module has the low-level reader and writer functions which we
      don't want to have to manually construct.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>save_message</literal> is then responsible for
      writing the binary content out to a <literal>bigstring</literal>.
      It first invokes the <literal>Binable.to_bigstring</literal> on a
      <literal>Message.t</literal> value to retrieve a marshalled
      string. It then determines the length of this string, and writes
      out the length and the string to the output channel.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>Binable</literal> interface in Core is pretty simple:

    </para>
    <para>
      Since the <literal>Binable.S</literal> module values are generated
      for you automatically, the only functions you'll need to regularly
      use are the conversion functions above.
    </para>
    <para>
      Reading back the binary value we've just defined is quite similar.
      We read in the length field, read that much data into a

      Similarly, sometimes you simultaneously want an accessor to a
      field of a record and a textual representation of the name of that
      field. This might come up if you were validating a field and
      needed the string representation to generate an error message, or
      if you wanted to scaffold a form in a GUI automatically based on
      the fields of a record. Fieldslib provides a module
      <literal>Field</literal> for this purpose. Here's some code for

  <title>First class modules</title>
  <para>
    OCaml provides several mechanisms for organizing your programs,
    including modules and functors, files and compilation units, and
    classes and objects. Files and compilation units
    (<literal>.ml</literal> and <literal>.mli</literal> files) are
    really just a simplified module system. Classes and objects are a
    different form of organization altogether (as we'll see in
    <xref linkend="object-oriented-programming"/>. Yet, in
    each of these cases, there is a clear separation between types and
    values -- values cannot contain types, and types cannot contain
    values. And since modules can contain types, modules can't be
    values.
  </para>
  <para>
    <emphasis>(yminsky: Instead of saying that ml and mli files are a
    simplified module system, maybe say that they &quot;provide a simple
    way of creating modules and interfaces&quot;, or some such? It's not
    like there's a simplified module system floating around)</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
    <emphasis>(yminsky: consider dropping &quot;Yet&quot; in the
    above.)</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
    Next, we'll relax this restriction with <emphasis>first-class
    modules</emphasis>. &quot;First-class&quot; means that modules can
    be passed around as ordinary values that can be created from and
    converted back to regular modules. This is a relatively recent
    addition to the OCaml language, and while it might seem trivial to
    say, it has profound consequences on the language. First-class
    modules are strictly more expressive than any other organization
    mechanism, including classes and objects. Once you use first-class
    modules, you'll never want to go back.
  </para>
  <para>
    <emphasis>(yminsky: I wouldn't say they're strictly more expressive.
    For example, they don't give you a way of expressing sub typing
    relationships effectively, which objects do.)</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
    This is not say that first-class modules should be used
    indiscriminately. When you pass modules as values, the reason is to
    support dynamic behavior, and this can have a negative impact on
    understandability. As we proceed, we'll compare first-class modules
    to other techniques, and suggest alternatives when it seems
    appropriate.
  </para>
  <para>
    _(jyh: Original text You can think of OCaml as being broken up into
    two sub-language: a core language that is concerned with values and
    types, and a module language that is concerned with modules and
    module signatures. These sub-languages are stratified, in that
    modules can contain types and values, but ordinary values can't
    contain modules or module types. That means you can't do things like
    define a variable whose definition is a module, or a function that
    takes a module as an argument.
  </para>
  <para>
    OCaml provides a way around this stratification in the form of
    <emphasis>first-class modules</emphasis>. First-class modules are
    ordinary values that can be created from and converted back to
    regular modules. As we'll see, letting modules into the core
    language makes it possible to use more flexible and dynamic
    module-oriented designs.)_

  <sect1 id="another-trivial-example">
    <title>Another trivial example</title>
    <para>
      Much as we did with functors, we'll start out with an utterly
      trivial example, to allow us to show the basic mechanics of first
      class modules with a minimum of fuss.
    </para>
    <para>
      A first-class module is created by packaging up a module with a
      signature that it satisfies. The following defines a simple
      signature and a module that matches it.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module type X_int = sig val x : int end;;
module type X_int = sig val x : int end
# module Three : X_int = struct let x = 3 end;;
module Three : X_int
# Three.x;;
- : int = 3
</programlisting>
    <para>
      We can then create a first-class module using the
      <literal>module</literal> keyword.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let three = (module Three : X_int);;
val three : (module X_int) = &lt;module&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Note that the type of the first-class module,
      <literal>(module X_int)</literal>, is based on the name of the
      signature that we used in constructing it.
    </para>
    <para>
      To get at the contents of <literal>three</literal>, we need to
      unpack it into a module again, which we can do using the
      <literal>val</literal> keyword.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# module New_three = (val three : X_int) ;;
module New_three : X_int
# New_three.x;;
- : int = 3
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Using these conversions as building blocks, we can create tools
      for working with first-class modules in a natural way. The
      following shows the definition of two function,
      <literal>to_int</literal>, which converts a
      <literal>(module X_int)</literal> into an <literal>int</literal>.
      And <literal>plus</literal>, which adds two
      <literal>(module X_int)</literal>s.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
# let to_int m =
    let module M = (val m : X_int) in
    M.x

val to_int : (module X_int) -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# let plus m1 m2 =
    (module struct
       let x = to_int m1 + to_int m2
     end : X_int)
  ;;
val plus : (module X_int) -&gt; (module X_int) -&gt; (module X_int) = &lt;fun&gt;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      With these functions in hand, we can start operating on our
      <literal>(module X_int)</literal>'s in a more natural style,
      taking full advantage of the concision and simplicity of the core
      language.
    </para>

      Of course, all we've really done with this example is come up with
      a more cumbersome way of working with integers. Let's see what

    <para>
      Let's compare the style of &quot;standard&quot; modules to
      first-class modules, using a simple library of abstract geometric
      shapes. In a &quot;standard&quot; module definition, we would
      define the shapes using abstract data types, where there is a type
      <literal>t</literal> that defines the actual representation, and
      the module would include functions that operate on the values of
      type <literal>t</literal>. In the following code, the module type
      <literal>Shape</literal> defines the type of generic shape, and
      the modules <literal>Rectangle</literal> and
      <literal>Line</literal> implement some concrete shapes.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
module type Shape = sig
  type t
  val area : t -&gt; int
  val position : t -&gt; int * int
end

module Rectangle = struct
   type t = { width : int; height : int; x : int; y : int }
   let make ~x ~y ~width ~height =
      { width = width; height = height; x = x; y = y }
   let area { width = width; height = height } = width * height
   let position { x = x; y = y } = (x, y)
end

module Line = struct
   type t = { dx : int; dy : int; x : int; y : int }
   let make ~x ~y ~dx ~dy = { dx = dx; dy = dy; x = x; y = y }
   let area _ = 0
   let position { x = x; y = y } = (x, y)
end
</programlisting>
    <para>
      Next, if we want to define a generic shape that is either a
      rectangle or a line, we would probably use a variant type. The
      following module <literal>Shapes</literal> is entirely
      boilerplate. We define the variant type, then functions to perform
      a dynamic dispatch based on the type of object.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
module Shapes = struct
   type t = [ `Rect of Rectangle.t | `Line of Line.t ]
   let make_rectangle = Rectangle.make
   let make_line = Line.make
   let area = function
      `Rect r -&gt; Rectangle.area r
    | `Line l -&gt; Line.area l
   let position = function
      `Rect r -&gt; Rectangle.position r
    | `Line l -&gt; Line.position l
end;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      In fact, confronted with this boilerplate, we would probably
      choose not use modules at all, but simply define a single module
      with a variant type and the code for all of the shapes. This isn't
      to say that separate code for separate shapes is bad, it just
      means that the language doesn't support it well (at least with
      standard modules).
    </para>
    <para>
      With first-class modules, the situation changes, but we have to
      dispense with the representation type altogether. For immutable
      shapes, the implementation is now trivial.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">

    <para>
      For mutable shapes, it isn't much different, but we have to
      include the state as values in the module implementations. For
      this, we'll define a representation type <literal>t</literal> in
      the module implementation, and for rectangles, a value
      <literal>rect</literal> of that type. The code for lines is
      similar.

    <title>A more complete example -- containers</title>

      So far, we haven't done anything that really needs modules. The
      type <literal>Shape</literal> could just as well be specified as a
      record type
      <literal>type shape = { area : int; position : int * int; ... }</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      To explore the topic more fully, let's implement a system of
      dynamic containers. OCaml already provides a set of standard
      containers like <literal>List</literal>, <literal>Set</literal>,
      <literal>Hashtbl</literal>, etc., but these types have to be
      selected statically. If a function expects a value of type
      <literal>Set.Make(ElementType).t</literal>, then you have to pass
      it a set of exactly that type. What we would like is a kind of
      container where the container implementation is chosen by the
      caller. We define an abstract <emphasis>interface</emphasis>, as a
      module type, then define one or more concrete module
      implementations.
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's start by defining an abstract container interface. It
      contains some elements of type <literal>elt</literal>, and
      functions to examine and iterate through the contents. For
      convenience, we also define a normal type
      <literal>'a container</literal> to represent containers with
      elements of type <literal>'a</literal>.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
module type Container = sig
   type elt
   val empty : unit -&gt; bool
   val iter : (elt -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit

    <sect2 id="imperative-containers">
      <title>Imperative containers</title>
      <para>
        For imperative containers, will also want functions to mutate
        the contents by adding or removing elements. For example, a
        stack can be implemented as a module <literal>Stack</literal>
        that includes all the functions in the generic
        <literal>Container</literal> module, as well as functions to
        push and pop elements.

      <para>
        Now that the types are defined, the next step is to define a
        concrete container implementation. For this simple example,
        we'll use a list to represent a stack. The function
        <literal>make_list_stack</literal> constructs module
        implementation using a <literal>let module</literal>
        construction, then returns the result.
      </para>

# let make_list_stack (type element) () : element stack =
    let module ListStack = struct

      let iter f = List.iter f !contents
      let fold f x = List.fold_left f x !contents
      let push x = contents := x :: !contents

</programlisting>
      <para>
        Note the use of the explicit type parameter
        <literal>element</literal>. This is required because the use of
        a type variable in the module definition (like
        <literal>type elt = 'a</literal>) would be rejected by the
        compiler. The construction and use of the stack is
        straightforward.

        We could go on to define other containers, sets, dictionaries,

      <para>
        Recursive modules provide a solution, but it requires a
        &quot;trick&quot;, where we define a module that is equal to
        itself. This module contains only type definitions, and the only
        purpose of the outer recursive module is to allow the recursion
        in the definition. While we're at it, let's include a
        <literal>map</literal> function with the usual semantics.

        There are several ways to write this model, but this definition
        is convenient because it defines both a module type
        <literal>Container.T</literal> and a value type
        <literal>'a Container.t</literal>. The outer recursive module
        <literal>Container</literal> allows the module type

        With this first technicality out of the way, the next one is how

        the imperative version of the stack, we used a function
        <literal>make_list_stack</literal>. We want to do the same here,

        The recursion here is particularly important. The functions
        <literal>map</literal> and <literal>add</literal> return new
        collections, so they call the function <literal>make</literal>
        recursively. The explicit polymorphic type

      <literal>handle_one</literal>, which handles a single interaction;
      and <literal>handle_loop</literal>, which creates the bundle and

      the interface of <literal>Bundle</literal> so that services can be
      registered along with their configs. At the same time, we'll
      change the <literal>Bundle</literal> API to allow services to be

        that use C structures in their interface.

      <title>Example: binding UNIX date functions</title>
      <para>
        The UNIX standard C library defines several useful time and date
        functions in <literal>&lt;time.h&gt;</literal> (usually found in
        <literal>/usr/include</literal> on a Linux or MacOS X system).
        The <literal>localtime</literal> function has the following
        signature and return value:

      <programlisting language="c">
/* /usr/include/time.h */

struct tm {
  int     tm_sec;         /* seconds after the minute [0-60] */
  int     tm_min;         /* minutes after the hour [0-59] */
  int     tm_hour;        /* hours since midnight [0-23] */

struct tm *localtime(const time_t *);
</programlisting>
      <para>
        This example is more complicated than ncurses for a couple of
        reasons. We need to allocate some external memory to store a
        <literal>time_t</literal> value, and pass that memory into the
        <literal>time</literal> library call to obtain the current
        timezone. This <literal>time_t</literal> value is passed to the
        <literal>localtime</literal> library call, which then returns a
        pointer to the <literal>struct tm</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>time_t</literal> and many other standard POSIX
        types are already provided by the
        <literal>Ffi.PosixTypes</literal> module. Let's start by
        defining the OCaml mapping to <literal>struct tm</literal>:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">

      <para>
        This is a fairly mechanical translation from the C structure by
        using the magic of the <literal>*:*</literal> combinator
        provided by the <literal>Ffi.C.Struct</literal> module. The
        structure is initialised in the <literal>tm</literal> variable
        via the <literal>structure</literal> allocator. The fields of
        the structure are then added in sequence. Each new field mutates
        the <literal>tm</literal> structure to append its name and
        offset. The structure is finalized via <literal>seals</literal>
        when all the fields have been added, and the structure can now
        be used.
      </para>
      <para>
        The OCaml definitions of <literal>time</literal> and
        <literal>localtime</literal> are now straightforward calls to
        <literal>foreign</literal>, just like our earlier

        The <literal>Ptr.allocate</literal> function allocates memory

        (<literal>timep</literal> in the example) has a finalizer
        function which frees the external memory when it is garbage
        collected. The <literal>timep</literal> pointer is passed into
        the <literal>time</literal> library call, which modifies it
        in-place. The same pointer is subsequently passed to

  <title>
  Why do OCaml types disappear at runtime?
  </title>
  <para>
    The OCaml compiler runs through several phases during the
    compilation process. The first phase is syntax checking, during
    which source files are parsed into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The
    next stage is a <emphasis>type checking</emphasis> pass over the
    AST. In a validly typed program, a function cannot be applied with
    an unexpected type. For example, the
    <literal>print_endline</literal> function must receive a single
    <literal>string</literal> argument, and an <literal>int</literal>
    will result in a type error.
  </para>
  <para>
    Since OCaml verifies these properties at compile time, it doesn't
    need to keep track of as much information at runtime. Thus, later
    stages of the compiler can discard and simplify the type
    declarations to a much more minimal subset that's actually required
    to distinguish polymorphic values at runtime. This is a major
    performance win versus something like a Java or .NET method call,
    where the runtime must look up the concrete instance of the object
    and dispatch the method call. Those languages amortize some of the
    cost via &quot;Just-in-Time&quot; dynamic patching, but OCaml
    prefers runtime simplicity instead.

    Let's start by explaining the garbage collector architecture, and
    then move onto the memory layout of OCaml values.

    <title>The garbage collector</title>
    <para>
      A running OCaml program uses blocks of memory (i.e. contiguous
      sequences of words in RAM) to represent many of the values that it
      deals with such as tuples, records, closures or arrays. An OCaml
      program implicitly allocates a block of memory when such a value
      is created.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
# let x = { foo = 13; bar = 14 } ;;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      An expression such as the record above requires a new block of
      memory with two words of available space. One word holds the
      <literal>foo</literal> field and the second word holds the
      <literal>bar</literal> field. The OCaml compiler translates such
      an expression into an explicit allocation for the block from
      OCaml's runtime system.
    </para>
    <para>
      The OCaml runtime is a C library that provides a collection of
      routines that can be called by running OCaml programs. The runtime
      manages a <emphasis>heap</emphasis>, which is a collection of
      memory regions it obtains from the operating system using
      <emphasis>malloc(3)</emphasis>. The OCaml runtime uses these
      memory regions to hold <emphasis>heap blocks</emphasis>, which it
      fills up in response to allocation requests by the OCaml program.

      <title>The mark and sweep GC strategy</title>
      <para>
        When there isn't enough memory available to satisfy an
        allocation request from the already-allocated heap blocks, the
        runtime system invokes the <emphasis>garbage
        collector</emphasis> (or GC). An OCaml program does not
        explicitly free a heap block when it is done with it. The GC
        determines which heap blocks are &quot;live&quot; and which heap
        blocks are &quot;dead&quot;, i.e. no longer in use. Dead blocks
        are collected and their memory made available for re-use by the
        application.
      </para>
      <para>
        The garbage collector does not keep constant track of blocks as
        they are allocated and used. Instead, it regularly scans blocks
        by starting from a set of <emphasis>roots</emphasis>, which are
        values that the application always has access to (such as the
        stack). The GC maintains a directed graph in which heap blocks
        are nodes. There is an edge from heap block
        <literal>b1</literal> to heap block <literal>b2</literal> if
        some field of <literal>b1</literal> points to
        <literal>b2</literal>. All blocks reachable from the roots by
        following edges in the graph must be retained, and unreachable
        blocks can be reused by the application. This strategy is
        commonly known as &quot;mark and sweep&quot; collection.

        The minor heap is one contiguous chunk of virtual memory
        containing a sequence of OCaml blocks. If there is space,
        allocating a new block is a fast constant-time operation in

        live blocks in the minor heap, which is typically small
        according to the generational hypothesis.

      <para>
        One complexity of generational collection arises from the fact
        that minor heap sweeps are much more frequent than major heap
        collections. In order to know which blocks in the minor heap are
        live, the collector must track which minor-heap blocks are
        directly pointed to by major-heap blocks. Without this

    <title>The representation of OCaml values</title>
    <para>
      We've described the overall memory layout, but not what the
      contents of each block contains. Every OCaml variable points to a
      <literal>value</literal> at runtime. A value is a single memory
      word that is either an integer or a pointer. The OCaml runtime
      needs to understand the difference between the two so that it can
      follow pointers to look for more values, but not integers (which
      directly hold the value and don't point to anything meaningful).
    </para>
    <sect2 id="distinguishing-integer-and-pointers-at-runtime">
      <title>Distinguishing integer and pointers at runtime</title>
      <para>
        Values use a single tag bit the word to distinguish integers and
        pointers at runtime. The value is an integer if the lowest bit
        of the block word is non-zero. Several OCaml types map onto this
        integer representation, including <literal>bool</literal>,
        <literal>int</literal>, the empty list, <literal>unit</literal>,
        and variants without constructors.
      </para>
      <para>
        Integers are unboxed runtime values in OCaml, which means that
        they can be stored directly without having to allocate a wrapper
        block that will take up more memory. They can also be passed
        directly to other function calls in registers, and are generally
        the cheapest and fastest values to use in OCaml.
      </para>
      <para>
        The value is treated as a memory pointer if the lowest bit of
        the <literal>value</literal> is zero. A pointer value is stored
        unmodified since pointers are guaranteed to be word-aligned with
        the bottom bits always being zero. The next problem is
        distinguishing between pointers to OCaml values (which should be
        followed by the garbage collector) and C pointers (which
        shouldn't be followed).
      </para>
      <para>
        The mechanism for this is simple since the runtime system keeps
        track of the heap blocks it has allocated for OCaml values. If
        the pointer is inside a heap chunk that is marked as being
        managed by the OCaml runtime, it is assumed to point to an OCaml
        value. If it points outside the OCaml runtime area, it is is
        treated as an opaque C pointer to some other system resource.

      <title>
      Some history about OCaml's word-aligned pointers
      </title>
      <para>
        The alert reader may be wondering how OCaml can guarantee that
        all of its pointers are word-aligned. In the old days when RISC
        chips such as Sparc, MIPS and Alpha were commonplace, unaligned
        memory accesses were forbidden by the instruction set
        architecture and would result in a CPU exception that terminated
        the program. Thus, all pointers were historically rounded off to
        the architecture word-size (usually 32- or 64-bits).
      </para>
      <para>
        Modern CISC processors such as the Intel x86 do support
        unaligned memory accesses, but the chip still runs faster if
        accesses are word-aligned. OCaml therefore simply mandates that
        all pointers be word-aligned, which guarantees that the bottom
        few bits of any valid pointer will be zero. Setting the bottom
        bit to a non-zero value is a simple way to mark an integer, at
        the cost of losing that single bit of precision.
      </para>
      <para>
        An even more alert reader will be wondering about the
        performance implications are for integer arithmetic using this
        tagged representation. Since the bottom bit is set, any
        operation on the integer has to shift the bottom bit right to
        recover the &quot;native&quot; value. The native code OCaml
        compiler generates efficient x86 assembly code in this case. It
        takes advantage of modern processor instructions to hide the
        extra shifts as much as possible. Addition and substraction are
        a single instruction, and multiplication is only a few more.

      <para>
        An OCaml <emphasis>block</emphasis> is the basic unit of
        allocation on the heap. A block consists of a one-word header
        (either 32- or 64-bits) followed by variable-length data that is
        either opaque bytes or an array of <emphasis>fields</emphasis>.
        The header has a multi-purpose tag byte that defines whether to
        interprete the subsequent data as opaque bytes or OCaml fields.
      </para>
      <para>
        The garbage collector never inspects opaque bytes. If the tag
        indicates an array of OCaml fields are present, their contents
        are all treated as more valid OCaml values. The garbage
        collector always inspects fields and follows them as part of the
        collection process described earlier.

        The <literal>size</literal> field records the length of the
        block in memory words. This is 22 bits on 32-bit platforms,
        which is the reason why OCaml strings are limited to 16MB on
        that architecture. If you need bigger strings, either switch to
        a 64-bit host, or use the <literal>Bigarray</literal> module
        described in
        <xref linkend="parsing-binary-protocols-with-bigarray"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The 2-bit <literal>color</literal> field is used by the garbage
        collector to keep track of its state during mark-and-sweep
        collection. This makes incremental collection possible, and
        isn't exposed directly to OCaml programs.

        A block's tag byte is multi-purpose, and indicates whether the
        data array represents opaque bytes or fields. If a block's tag
        is greater than or equal to <literal>No_scan_tag</literal>
        (251), then the block's data are all opaque bytes, and are not
        scanned by the collector. The most common such block is the

        Many basic types are efficiently stored as unboxed integers at
        runtime. The native <literal>int</literal> type is the most
        obvious, although it drops a single bit of precision due to the
        tag bit. Other atomic types such as <literal>unit</literal> and
        empty list <literal>[]</literal> value are stored as constant
        integers. Boolean values have a value of <literal>0</literal>
        and <literal>1</literal> for <literal>true</literal> and
        <literal>false</literal> respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        These basic types such as empty lists and
        <literal>unit</literal> are very efficient to use since integers
        are never allocated on the heap. They can be passed directly in
        registers and not appear on the stack if you don't have too many
        parameters to your functions. Modern architectures as as
        <literal>x86_64</literal> have a lot of spare registers to
        further improve the efficiency of using unboxed integers.

        Floating point numbers in OCaml are always stored as full

        stored as a block with a single field that contains the number.
        This block has the <literal>Double_tag</literal> set which

        Since each floating-point value is boxed in a separate memory
        block, it can be inefficient to handle large arrays of floats in
        comparison to unboxed integers. OCaml therefore special-cases
        records or arrays that contain <emphasis>only</emphasis>
        <literal>float</literal> types. These are stored in a block that
        contains the floats packed directly in the data section, with

        The hash function is designed to give the same results on 32-bit
        and 64-bit architectures, so the memory representation is stable
        across different CPUs and host types.
      </para>
      <para>
        Polymorphic variants use more memory space than normal variants
        when parameters are included in the datatype constructors.
        Normal variants use the tag byte to encode the variant value and
        save the fields for the contents, but this single byte is
        insufficient to encode the hashed value for polymorphic
        variants. They must allocate a new block (with tag
        <literal>0</literal>) and store the value in there instead.
        Polymorphic variants with constructors thus use one word of
        memory more than normal variant constructors.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another inefficiency over normal variants is when a polymorphic
        variant constructor has more than one parameter. Normal variants
        hold parameters as a single flat block with multiple fields for
        each entry, but polymorphic variants must adopt a more flexible
        uniform memory representation since they may be re-used in a
        different context across compilation units. They allocate a
        tuple block for the parameters that is pointed to from the
        argument field of the variant. There are thus three additional
        words for such variants, along with an extra memory indirection
        due to the tuple.
      </para>
      <para>
        The extra space usage is generally not significant in a typical
        application, and polymorphic variants offer a great deal more
        flexibility than normal variants. However, if you're writing
        code that demands high performance or must run within tight
        memory bounds, the runtime layout is at least very predictable.
        The OCaml compiler never switches memory representation due to
        optimization passes. This lets you predict the precise runtime
        layout by referring to these guidelines and your source code.

        <literal>No_scan_tag</literal>, indicating that the contents of
        the block are opaque to the collector. The block contents are

        This string representation is a clever way to ensure that the
        contents are always zero-terminated by the padding word, and
        still compute its length efficiently without scanning the whole
        string. The following formula is used:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
number_of_words_in_block * sizeof(word) - last_byte_of_block - 1
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The guaranteed <literal>NULL</literal>-termination comes in
        handy when passing a string to C, but is not relied upon to
        compute the length from OCaml code. OCaml strings can thus
        contain <literal>NULL</literal> bytes at any point within the
        string. Care should be taken that any C library functions that
        receive these buffers can cope with arbitrary
        <literal>NULL</literal> values within the buffer contents.

        in the OCaml heap like an ordinary block and can be of whatever

  <title>The Compilation Pipeline</title>
  <para>
    Compiling source code into executable programs is a fairly complex
    process that involves quite a few tools -- preprocessors, compilers,
    runtime libraries, linkers and assemblers. It's important how to
    understand how these fit together to help with your day-to-day
    workflow of developing, debugging, maintaining and deploying
    applications.
  </para>
  <para>
    OCaml has a strong emphasis on static type safety and tries to
    reject source code that doesn't meet its requirements as early as
    possible. The compiler toolchain implements these checks as a series
    of transformations that start with the source code. Each stage
    checks some properties and discards information from the previous
    stage, until the final output is low-level assembly code that no
    longer knows anything about OCaml modules or objects.
  </para>
  <para>
    TODO note about how this different from JVM/NET w type erasure?
  </para>
  <para>
    Much of this complexity is hidden away via the OCaml build system.
    However, you'll sometime need to dive into the toolchain to hunt
    down a bug or investigate a performance regression. In these cases,
    you can manually run a stage and examine the output more closely.
  </para>
  <para>
    It's even possible to compile OCaml to run efficiently on
    environments such as Javascript or the Java Virtual Machine. These
    are third-party tools that extend the core compilation toolchain,
    and so it helps to understand how everything fits together before
    starting to use them.

      The OCaml tools accept textual source code as input with filename
      extensions of <literal>.ml</literal> and <literal>.mli</literal>
      for modules and signatures respectively. Each source file
      represents a <emphasis>compilation unit</emphasis> that is built
      separately. The compiler generates intermediate files with
      different filename extensions to use as it advances through the
      compilation stages. Finally, the compiler linker gathers together
      a collection of compiled compilation units and produces a
      standalone executable or library archive that can be re-used by
      other applications.

      Notice that the pipeline branches towards the end. This is because
      OCaml has multiple compiler frontends that re-use the early stages
      of compilation, but produce very different final outputs. The
      bytecode interpreter is portable and lightweight (and can be
      transformed into Javascript), whereas the native code compiler
      generates specialized native code binaries suitable for
      high-performance applications.

      The first thing the compiler does is parse the input source files

      Syntax Tree (AST) data structure. This parser is implemented in

        One powerful feature in OCaml is the facility to extend the
        language grammar via the <literal>camlp4</literal> macro tool.
        Camlp4 modules can register new keywords with the lexer and
        later transform these keywords (or indeed, any portion of the
        input program) into conventional OCaml code that can be
        understood by the rest of the compiler.

        The syntax extension packages cause <literal>ocamlfind</literal>
        to generate a <literal>-pp</literal> option to the compiler, ith
        the preprocessing modules as arguments. These preprocessor
        modules are dynamically loaded into the
        <literal>camlp4o</literal> command-line tool, which rewrites the
        input token stream from the source code into conventional OCaml
        code that has no trace of the new keywords. The compiler then
        continues on to compile this transformed code.

      <para>
        Both <literal>fieldslib</literal> and <literal>sexplib</literal>
        need this <literal>with</literal> keyword, so there is a common
        preprocessor library called <literal>type_conv</literal> that
        provides the extension framework for them to use. Type_conv
        defines the <literal>with</literal> grammar extension and

        The preprocessor extensions can now generate boiler-plate OCaml

        inevitable performance hit of doing this generation dynamically,
        but also doesn't require a complex Just-In-Time (JIT) runtime
        that is a source of unpredictable dynamic behaviour. Instead,

          OCaml provides a polymorphic comparison operator that inspects
          the runtime representation of two values to see if they are
          equal. As we noted in

          directive. This is intercepted by

        <para>
          Syntax extensions are a very powerful extension mechanism that
          can completely change your source code's layout and style.
          Core includes a very conservative set of extensions that
          minimise the syntax changes. There are a number of third-party
          libraries that perform much more wide-sweeping changes, such
          as introducing whitespace-sensitive indentation or even
          building entirely new languages.
        </para>
        <para>
          While it's tempting to compress all your boiler-plate code
          into <literal>camlp4</literal> extensions, it can make
          production source code much harder for other people to read
          and review. Core mainly focuses on type-driven code generation
          using the <literal>type_conv</literal> extension, and doesn't
          fundamentally change the OCaml syntax.
        </para>
        <para>
          Another thing to consider before deploying your own syntax
          extension is compatibility with other syntax extensions. Two
          separate extensions create a grammar clash can lead to
          hard-to-reproduce bugs. That's why most of Core's syntax
          extensions go through <literal>type_conv</literal>, which acts
          as a single point for extending the grammar via the
          <literal>with</literal> keyword.

    <para>
      After obtaining a valid parsed AST (with or without
      <literal>camlp4</literal>) the compiler must then check that the
      code obeys the rules of the static type system. Code that is
      syntactically correct but misuses values is rejected with an
      explanation of the problem at this stage. We're not going to delve

      compilation process.

        on <literal>Pervasives</literal> by default, unless you use the

        use-case, and you shouldn't need it in normal use).

      <para>
        The long alphanumeric identifier beside each module name is a
        hash calculated from all the types and values exported from that
        compilation unit. This is used during type-checking and linking
        to check that all of the compilation units have been compiled
        consistently against each other. A difference in the hashes
        means that a compilation unit with the same module name may have
        conflicting type signatures in different modules. This violates
        static type safety if these conflicting instances are ever
        linked together, as every well-typed value has precisely one
        type in OCaml.
      </para>
      <para>
        This hash check ensures that separate compilation remains type
        safe all the way up to the final link phase. Each source file is

        external modules is recorded with the compiled signature.

        This is rather a lot of output for a simple two-line program,
        but also reveals a lot about how the compiler works. Each
        portion of the tree is decorated with the precise location
        information (including the filename and character location of
        the token). This code hasn't been type checked yet, and so the
        raw tokens are all included. After type checking, the structure
        is much simpler.

            in the order which they appear. The pattern matching engine

      After the lambda form has been generated, we are very close to
      having executable code. The OCaml tool-chain branches into two

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      <literal>ocamlrun</literal> is an interpreter that uses the OCaml
      stack and an accumulator to store values, and only has seven
      registers in total (the program counter, stack pointer,
      accumulator, exception and argument pointers, and environment and
      global data). It implements around 140 opcodes which form the
      OCaml program. The full details of the opcodes are available

    <para>
      The big advantage of using <literal>ocamlc</literal> is
      simplicity, portability and compilation speed. The mapping from

      in predictable (but slow) execution speed.

      <title>Compiling and linking OCaml bytecode</title>
      <para>
        <literal>ocamlc</literal> compiles individual
        <literal>ml</literal> files into bytecode <literal>cmo</literal>
        files. These are linked together with the OCaml standard library
        to produce an executable program. The order in which
        <literal>.cmo</literal> arguments are presented on the command
        line defines the order in which compilation units are
        initialized at runtime (recall that OCaml has no single
        <literal>main</literal> function like C does).
      </para>
      <para>
        A typical OCaml library consists of multiple modules (and hence
        multiple <literal>cmo</literal> files).
        <literal>ocamlc</literal> can combine these into a single
        <literal>cma</literal> bytecode archive by using the
        <literal>-a</literal> flag. The objects in the library are
        linked as regular <literal>cmo</literal> files in the order
        specified when the library file was built. However, if an object
        file within the library isn't referenced elsewhere in the
        program, it is not linked unless the <literal>-linkall</literal>
        flag forces it to be included. This behaviour is analogous to
        how C handles object files and archives (<literal>.o</literal>
        and <literal>.a</literal> respectively).
      </para>
      <para>
        The bytecode runtime comprises three main parts: the bytecode
        interpreter, garbage collector, and a set of C functions that
        implement the primitive operations. Bytecode instructions are
        provided to call these C functions. The OCaml linker produces
        bytecode for the standard runtime system by default, and any
        custom C functions in your code (e.g. from C bindings) require
        the runtime to dynamically load a shared library.
      </para>
      <para>
        This can be specified as follows:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
$ ocamlc -a -o mylib.cma a.cmo b.cmo -dllib -lmylib
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The <literal>dllib</literal> flag embeds the arguments in the
        archive file. Any subsequent packages including this archive
        will also include the extra linking directive. This lets the
        <literal>ocamlrun</literal> runtime locate the extra symbols
        when it executes the bytecode.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also generate a complete standalone executable that
        bundles the <literal>ocamlrun</literal> interpreter with the
        bytecode in a single binary. This is known as the
        &quot;custom&quot; runtime mode, and can be run by:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
$ ocamlc -a -o mylib.cma -custom a.cmo b.cmo -cclib -lmylib
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The custom mode is the most similar to native code compilation,
        as both generate standalone executables. There are quite a few
        other options available for compiling bytecode (notably with
        shared libraries or building custom runtimes). Full details can
        be found in the
        <ulink url="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual022.html">manual</ulink>.

          A consequence of using the bytecode compiler is that the final
          link phase must be performed by <literal>ocamlc</literal>.
          However, you might sometimes want to embed your OCaml code
          inside an existing C application. OCaml also supports this
          mode of operation via the <literal>-output-obj</literal>
          directive.

        <para>
          This mode causes <literal>ocamlc</literal> to output a C
          object file that containing the bytecode for the OCaml part of
          the program, as well as a <literal>caml_startup</literal>
          function. The object file can then be linked with other C code
          using the standard C compiler, or even turned in a standalone

          it all fits together.

      optimization passes that the bytecode interpreter doesn't perform.
      However, care is taken to ensure compatibility with the bytecode

      When the compiler links modules together into an executable, it
      uses the contents of the <literal>cmx</literal> files to perform
      cross-module inlining across compilation units. This can be a
      significant speedup for standard library functions that are
      frequently used outside of their module.

    <para>
      Collections of <literal>.cmx</literal> and <literal>.o</literal>
      files can also be be linked into a <literal>.cmxa</literal>
      archive by passing the <literal>-a</literal> flag to the compiler.
      However, unlike the bytecode version, you must keep the individual
      <literal>cmx</literal> files in the compiler search path so that
      they are available for cross-module inlining. If you don't do
      this, the compilation will still succeed, but you will have missed

          The native code compiler also supports

          compiler. The native code runtime is called

        <para>
          Despite your best efforts, it is easy to introduce a bug into
          C bindings that cause heap invariants to be violated. OCaml
          includes a variant of the runtime library
          <literal>libasmrun.a</literal> that is compiled with debugging
          symbols. This is available as <literal>libasmrund.a</literal>
          and includes extra memory integrity checks upon every garbage
          collection cycle. Running these often will abort the program
          near the point of corruption and helps isolate the bug.
        </para>
        <para>
          To use this debug library, just link with

          If you get an error that <literal>libasmrund.a</literal> is

    You should now understand the runtime structure of the OCaml heap

    OCaml defines an <literal>external</literal> keyword that maps OCaml
    functions to a C symbol. When the function is invoked from OCaml,
    the C function will be called with the OCaml function arguments
    using their native <literal>value</literal> representation. This
    corresponds to the memory layout for OCaml values described earlier.

      Let's define a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; C binding to see how
      this works. First create a <literal>hello.ml</literal> that
      contains the external declaration:
    </para>

      If you try to compile this module to an executable now, you should
      receive a linker error:

</programlisting>
    <para>
      This is the system linker telling you that there is a missing
      <literal>caml_hello_world</literal> symbol. We need to provide a C
      file that will implement this function and make it available to
      the linker before it creates a standalone executable. The OCaml
      compiler uses file extensions to determine how to compile each
      file. When it sees a <literal>.c</literal> extension, it passes it
      to the system C compiler and appends an include directory
      containing the OCaml runtime header files. You can find these
      runtime header files by running <literal>ocamlc -where</literal>
      and looking under the <literal>caml/</literal> subdirectory.
    </para>
    <para>
      <literal>mlvalues.h</literal> is the basic header file that all
      OCaml-C bindings need. It is also shared by the garbage collector,
      and defines a few important typedefs early on that should be
      familiar after the earlier explanation about the memory
      representation of OCaml values:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="c">
typedef intnat value;

#define Is_long(x)   (((x) &amp; 1) != 0)
#define Is_block(x)  (((x) &amp; 1) == 0)

#define Val_unit Val_int(0)
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>value</literal> typedef is a memory word that can
      either be an integer if <literal>Is_long</literal> is true, or a
      heap block if <literal>Is_block</literal> is true. All of the
      arguments passed to the C bindings will be of type
      <literal>value</literal>, since this is sufficient to represent
      any valid OCaml value in memory. Let's look at the external
      declaration for <literal>hello_world</literal> again:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="ocaml">
external hello_world: unit -&gt; unit = &quot;caml_hello_world&quot;
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This external function has a single argument of type
      <literal>unit</literal>, which is represented as an integer of
      value 0 in memory. Our C function definition of
      <literal>caml_hello_world</literal> must therefore accept a single
      <literal>value</literal> parameter and return a
      <literal>value</literal>. Let's create the
      <literal>hello_stubs.c</literal> file now that implements this:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;caml/mlvalues.h&gt;

CAMLprim value
caml_hello_world(value v_unit)

  printf(&quot;Hello OCaml World from C!\n&quot;);
  return Val_unit;
}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      You can now recompile the <literal>hello</literal> binary with
      this additional C file included in the compiler command-line, and
      it should succeed:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ ocamlopt -o hello hello.ml hello_stubs.c

</programlisting>
    <para>
      You must be <emphasis>very</emphasis> careful that the value you
      return from the C function corresponds exactly to the memory
      representation of the types you declared earlier in the
      <literal>external</literal> declaration of the ML file, or else
      heap carnage and corruption will ensure.

      The earlier hello world example is rather basic and only uses
      <literal>unit</literal> types. Let's extend the signature to take
      a couple of <literal>int</literal> arguments instead of a single
      <literal>unit</literal> so that we can send more useful data
      between OCaml and C:

</programlisting>
    <para>
      The <literal>add_numbers</literal> external function now takes two
      arguments, and returns an integer instead of a simple
      <literal>unit</literal>. The updated C stub looks like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

CAMLprim value
caml_add_numbers(value v_arg1, value v_arg2)

  int v1 = Int_val(v_arg1);
  int v2 = Int_val(v_arg2);
  printf(&quot;From C:     %d + %d\n&quot;, v1, v2);
  return Val_int(v1+v2);
}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      OCaml passes the integers to <literal>caml_add_numbers</literal>
      as <literal>value</literal> types, so the binding uses the
      <literal>Int_val</literal> macro to convert them into local stack
      variables. The <literal>Int_val</literal> macro converts a
      <literal>value</literal> to an integer by removing the tag bit.
      The C integers are then added together and the result
      <literal>value</literal> is constructed by applying the
      <literal>Val_int</literal> macro, which takes a C integer and tags
      it into becoming an OCaml <literal>value</literal>. When you
      compile and run this version of the code, you should see this
      output:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ ./hello

From OCaml: 25
</programlisting>
    <para>
      You should keep an eye out for warnings from your compiler which
      often indicate that you've forgotten to correctly convert a
      <literal>value</literal>. For example, try a broken version of the
      previous binding:
    </para>
    <programlisting language="c">

  printf(&quot;From C:     %d + %d\n&quot;, v_arg1, v_arg2);
  return Val_int(v_arg1 + v_arg2);
}
</programlisting>
    <para>
      The compiler will now complain of invalid format strings when you
      compile this:
    </para>
    <programlisting>

</programlisting>
    <para>
      Notice that both the input and output integers are incorrect in
      the output, since they still have their tag bits set when being
      added in the C code. Don't depend on the good graces of your C
      compiler to always spot such errors though. It's also invalid to
      add two <literal>value</literal>s together without converting them
      into native C type, but the C compiler can't warn about this and
      the result is silently incorrect. It's good practise to
      immediately convert arguments to local C stack variables as early
      as possible, so you don't get the types mixed up deep into the C
      function.

    <para>
      OCaml provides macros to convert to and from all the basic OCaml
      runtime values and C types, of the form
      <literal>to_from</literal>. For example
      <literal>Val_long</literal> means &quot;Value from long&quot;, and
      <literal>Long_val</literal> means &quot;Long from value&quot;. The
      table below summarises the macros to extract various C types from
      OCaml <literal>values</literal> for 64-bit architectures. Note
      that OCaml doesn't support a single-precision float, so these are
      always double-precision.

    <title>Constructing OCaml values from C</title>
    <para>
      Building OCaml values to return from C is a little more involved,
      since we must ensure that any OCaml allocations aren't immediately
      cleaned up by the garbage collector before they have been
      registered as live values. Luckily, OCaml provides some more
      macros to make this easier to enforce. Let's extend our earlier
      example to return a tuple of integers instead of just the result.

    <para>
      The <literal>add_numbers</literal> external now returns a more
      complex data type that requires allocating an OCaml tuple from
      within the C binding, storing the results within the tuple, and
      returning that tuple. The contents of the tuple are also a mix of
      immediate values (the two first <literal>int</literal> fields in
      the tuple) and the last boxed <literal>int32</literal> that also
      needs to be allocated on the OCaml heap.

      with the garbage collector. This ensures that if the garbage
      collector is triggered during the C binding, it will not relocate
      or free the value we just allocated. We also need to allocate a
      tuple to store the result. This is declared with the
      <literal>CAMLlocal</literal> macro, and returned via
      <literal>CAMLreturn</literal>. For many simple bindings, you can
      just follow the simple rule of replacing the C
      <literal>return</literal> with <literal>CAMLreturn</literal> and
      starting every function with <literal>CAMLparam</literal> and
      <literal>CAMLlocal</literal>, and not have to worry about the
      garbage collector.

    <para>
      The OCaml runtime divides the address space into memory pages of
      4KB each (this is configurable by recompiling the runtime). At any
      given time, every page that is in use is used for a single
      purpose: major heap, minor heap, static data or code. The runtime
      guarantees this by always allocating slightly more memory than
      requested so that that it can choose align the memory it will
      actually use at the beginning of a 4KB page.
    </para>
    <para>
      The runtime maintains a <emphasis>page table</emphasis> that
      allows it to determine the status of any virtual memory address in
      the operating system process. The status defines whether that
      address is a page in use by the OCaml runtime, and if so, which of
      the four purposes it is being used for.
    </para>
    <para>
      Since the virtual memory space can be very large and sparsely used
      (especially on a 64-bit CPU), the page table is implemented as a
      hash table in which keys are page-aligned addresses and values are
      a single byte. The hash table is represented as an array of words,
      with each word being a key-value pair. The key-value pair is the
      bitwise <literal>or</literal> of the virtual address of the start
      of the page (which has zeros for its lower 12-bits due to being
      aligned to 4KB), and the lower 8 bits are used for the value. To
      look up an address, one masks out the lower 12-bits of the memory
      address, compute a multiplicative hash to get a table index, and
      then compares against the address (i.e. the key) at that index.
      Linear probing is used to resolve collisions.

        Allocating a block on the major heap first checks the free list

        will be large enough. That block is then added to the free list,

          <literal>flp[i]</literal> is not big enough for our new block,
          then we may as well skip to <literal>flp[i+1]</literal>,
          because everything in the free list before then will also be
          too small.
        </para>
        <para>
          If there's nothing big enough in the <literal>flp</literal>
          array, we extend it by walking the free list starting at the
          <emphasis>last</emphasis> pointer in the
          <literal>flp</literal>-array, say <literal>flp[N]</literal>.
          We extend the <literal>flp</literal> array along the way, so
          that at each block, if this block is bigger than the current
          last thing in <literal>flp</literal> (which is equivalent to
          saying this is the biggest block we've ever seen, since the
          blocks pointed to by the <subscript>flp</subscript> array are
          increasing in size), we add it to the end of
          <subscript>flp</subscript>. We stop this walk when we come
          across a block big enough to house our desired new block.
        </para>
        <para>
          There's also the case when the <literal>flp</literal> array
          has its ceiling size of <literal>FLP_MAX</literal> (default
          100). Then we just start at the end of the
          <literal>flp</literal> array and walk until we find something
          big enough. This is known in the as a slow first-fit search,
          since this linear walk may take a long time.
        </para>
        <para>
          If we did manage to find something suitable in the
          <literal>flp</literal> array, say at index
          <literal>i</literal>, we need to update
          <literal>flp</literal>. This update is rather complex, and the
          reason why first-fit allocation is slower than next-fit. We
          walk through the free list between <literal>flp[i-1]</literal>
          and <literal>flp[i]</literal> and record every high point we
          come across. Say we find <literal>j</literal> such points. We
          move the upper portion of <literal>flp</literal> (from
          <literal>flp[i+1]</literal> to the end) to the right by
          <literal>j</literal> places and insert each new high point
          into the array. There is a further corner case when adding in
          <literal>j</literal> new high points would make
          <literal>flp</literal> bigger than <literal>FLP_MAX</literal>.

        Most incremental generational garbage collectors have to keep
        careful track of values pointing from old generations to younger
        ones. The OCaml runtime is no exception, and maintains a set of
        addresses in the major heap that may point into the minor heap.
        These addresses are <emphasis>not</emphasis> OCaml pointers, and
        just literal memory addresses. The runtime ensures that it never
        relocates values in the major heap unless this
        &quot;remembered&quot; set is empty. The set is maintained as a
        dynamically resized array of pointers, which is itself
        maintained via a collection of pointers known as the
        <literal>caml_ref_table</literal>.

          The write barrier is one of the reasons why using immutable
          data structures can sometimes be faster than mutable records.
          The OCaml compiler keeps track of any mutable types and adds a
          call to <literal>caml_modify</literal> before making the
          change. The <literal>caml_modify</literal> checks that the
          remembered set is consistent, which, although reasonably
          efficient, can be slower than simply allocating a fresh value
          on the fast minor heap.

          Let's see this for ourselves with a simple test program:

        <para>
          This program defines a type <literal>t1</literal> that is
          mutable, and <literal>t2</literal> that is immutable. The main
          loop iterates over both fields and runs a simple counter. It
          measures two things: the wallclock time that all the
          iterations take, and the number of minor garbage collections
          that occurred during the test. The results are very
          hardware-dependent, but on a modern Intel i7 processor they
          look something like this:
        </para>

immutable: 2.6186s (19073 minor collections)

        <para>
          Notice the space/time tradeoff here. The mutable version runs
          almost 4 times slower than the immutable one, but has
          significantly fewer garbage collection cycles. Minor
          collections in OCaml are very fast, and so it is often
          acceptable to use immutable data structures in preference to
          the more conventional mutable versions. On the other hand, if
          you only rarely mutable a value, it can be faster to take the
          write barrier hit and not allocate at all.

      <para>
        For those familiar with garbage collection terminology, here is
        OCaml's minor colection in one sentence. OCaml's minor
        collection uses copying collection with forwarding pointers, and
        does a depth-first traversal of the block graph using a stack
        represented as a linked list threaded through blocks that need
        to be scanned.
      </para>
      <para>
        The goal of minor collection is to empty the minor heap by
        moving to the major heap every block in the minor heap that
        might be used in the future, and updating each pointer to a
        moved block to the new version of the block. A block is
        <emphasis>live</emphasis> if it is reachable by starting at some
        <emphasis>root</emphasis> pointer into a block in the minor
        heap, and then following pointers in blocks. There are many
        different kinds of roots:

      <para>
        Moving a block between heaps is traditionally called
        <emphasis>forwarding</emphasis>. The OCaml runtime code uses
        that term as well as the term <emphasis>oldify</emphasis>, which
        is useful to understand when profiling hotspots in your code.
        The minor collector first visits all roots and forwards them if
        they point to a block in the minor heap. When a block is
        forwarded, the collector sets the tag of the original block to a
        special <literal>Forward_tag</literal> (250), and the first
        field of the original block to point to the new block. Then, if
        the collector ever encounters a pointer to the original block
        again, it can simply update the pointer directly into the
        forwarded block.
      </para>
      <para>
        Because a forwarded block might itself contain pointers, it must
        at some point be scanned to see if those pointers point to
        blocks in the minor heap, so that those blocks can also be
        forwarded. The collector maintains a linked list (called the
        <literal>oldify_todo_list</literal>) of forwarded objects that
        it still needs to scan. That linked list looks like:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
                oldify_todo_list
                   |
                   |
                   v
   minor heap  | 0 | v | f1 ... |      | 0 | v | f1 ... |
                     |                     ^ |
                     |      +--------------+ |      ---------- ...
                     v      |                v      |
   major heap    | h | f0 | ^ | ... |    | h | f0 | ^
</programlisting>
      <para>
        Each value on the <literal>oldify_todo_list</literal> is marked
        as forwarded, and the first word points to the new block in the
        major heap. That new version contains the actual value header,
        the real first field of the value, and a link (pointer) to the
        next value on the oldify_todo_list, or
        <subscript>NULL</subscript> at the end of the list. Clearly this
        approach won't work if an value has only one field, since there
        will be no second field to store the link in. Values with
        exactly one field are never put on the
        <literal>oldify_todo_list</literal>; instead, the collector
        immediately traverses them, essentially making a tail call in
        the depth-first search.
      </para>
      <para>
        Values that are known from the tag in their header to not
        contain pointers are simply forwarded and completely copied, and
        never placed on the <literal>oldify_todo_list</literal>. These
        tags are all greater than <literal>No_scan_tag</literal> and
        include strings and float arrays.
      </para>
      <para>
        (<emphasis>avsm</emphasis>: note from sweeks to investigate:
        There is a hack for objects whose tag is
        <literal>Forward_tag</literal> that does some kind of path
        compression, or at least removal of one link, but I'm not sure
        what's going on.)
      </para>
      <para>
        (<emphasis>avsm</emphasis>: I dont think we've introduced weak
        references yet, so this needs rearranging) At the end of the
        depth-first search in minor collection, the collector scans the
        <literal>weak-ref</literal> table, and clears any weak
        references that are still pointing into the minor heap. The
        collector then empties the <literal>weak-ref</literal> table and
        the minor heap.

      <para>
        Marking maintains an array of gray blocks,
        <literal>gray_vals</literal>. It uses as them as a stack,
        pushing on a white block that is then colored gray, and popping
        off a gray block when it is scanned and colored black. The
        <literal>gray_vals</literal> array is allocated via
        <emphasis>malloc(3)</emphasis>, and there is a pointer,
        <literal>gray_vals_cur</literal>, to the next open spot in the
        array.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>gray_vals</literal> array initially has 2048
        elements. <literal>gray_vals_cur</literal> starts at
        <literal>gray_vals</literal>, and increases until it reachs
        <literal>gray_vals_end</literal>, at which point the
        <literal>gray_vals</literal> array is doubled, as long as its
        size (in bytes) is less than 1/2^10th of the heap size
        (<literal>caml_stat_heap_size</literal>). When the gray vals is
        of its maximum allowed size, it isn't grown any further, and the
        heap is marked as impure (<literal>heap_is_pure=0</literal>),
        and last half of <literal>gray_vals</literal> is ignored (by
        setting <literal>gray_vals_cur</literal> back to the middle of
        the <literal>gray_vals</literal> array.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the marking is able to complete using just the gray list, it
        will. Otherwise, once the gray list is emptied, the mark phase
        will observe that the heap is impure and initiate a backup
        approach to marking. In this approach it marks the heap as pure
        and then walks through the entire heap block by block, in
        increasing order of memory address. If it finds a gray block, it
        adds it to the gray list and does a DFS marking using the gray
        list as a stack in the usual way. Once the scan of the complete
        heap is finished, the mark phase checks again whether the heap
        has again become impure, and if so initiates another scan. These
        full-heap scans will continue until a successful scan completes
        without overflowing the gray list.

    The easiest way to use OCaml is via the binary packages available
    for many operating systems. For day-to-day code development however,
    it's much easier to use a source-code manager that lets you modify
    individual libraries and automatically recompile all the
    dependencies.
  </para>
  <para>
    An important difference between OCaml and scripting languages such
    as Python or Ruby is the static type safety that means that you
    can't just mix-and-match compiled libraries. Interfaces are checked
    when libraries are compiled, so when an interface is changed, all
    the dependent libraries must also be recompiled. Source-based
    package managers automate this process for you and make development
    life much easier.

    <para>
      When the <literal>init</literal> command finishes, you'll see some
      instructions about environment variables. OPAM never installs
      files into your system directories (which would require
      administrator privileges). Instead, it puts them into your home
      directory by default, and can output a set of shell commands which
      configures your shell with the right <literal>PATH</literal>
      variables so that packages will just work. This requires just one
      command:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ eval `opam config -env`
</programlisting>
    <para>
      This evaluates the results of running
      <literal>opam config env</literal> in your current shell, and sets
      the variables so that subsequent commands will use them. This only
      works with your current shell, and it can be automated for all
      future shells by adding the line to your login scripts. On Mac OS
      X or Debian, this is usually the
      <literal>~/.bash_profile</literal> file if you're using the
      default shell. If you've switched to another shell, it might be
      <literal>~/.zshrc</literal> instead. OPAM isn't unusual in this
      approach; the SSH <literal>ssh-agent</literal> also works
      similarly, so if you're having any problems just hunt around in
      your configuration scripts to see how that's being invoked.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you answered <literal>yes</literal> to the auto-complete

      The most important package we need to install is Core, which is
      the replacement standard library that all of the examples in this
      book use. Before doing this, let's make sure you have exactly the
      right compiler version you need. We've made some minor
      modifications to the way the OCaml compiler displays type
      signatures, and the next command will install a patched
      <literal>4.01.0</literal> compiler with this functionality
      enabled.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
$ opam switch 4.01.0dev+trunk

    <para>
      This step will take about 5-10 minutes on a modern machine, and
      will download and install (within the <literal>~/.opam</literal>
      directory) a custom OCaml compiler. OPAM supports multiple such
      installations, and you'll find this very useful if you ever decide
      to hack on the internals of the compiler itself, or you want to
      experiment with the latest release without sacrificing your
      current installation. You only need to install this compiler once,
      and future updates will be much faster as they only recompile
      libraries within the compiler installation.
    </para>
    <para>
      The new compiler will be installed into
      <literal>~/.opam/4.01.0dev+trunk</literal> and any libraries you
      install for it will be tracked separately from your system
      installation. You can have any number of compilers installed
      simultaneously, but only one can be active at any time. Browse
      through the available compilers by running
      <literal>opam switch list</literal>.

        There's one last tool you need before getting started on the
        examples. The default <literal>ocaml</literal> command gives us
        an interactive command-line to experiment with code without
        compiling it. However, it's quite a spartan experience and so we
        use a more modern alternative.
      </para>

$ opam install utop
</programlisting>
      <para>
        The <literal>utop</literal> package is an interactive
        command-line interface to OCaml that has tab-completion,
        persistent history and integration with Emacs so that you can
        run it within your editing environment.
      </para>
      <para>
        Remember from earlier that OPAM never installs files directly
        into your system directories, and this applies to
        <literal>utop</literal> too. You'll find the binary in
        <literal>~/.opam/4.01.0dev+trunk/bin</literal>. However, just
        typing in <literal>utop</literal> from your shell should just
        work, due to the <literal>opam config env</literal> step that
        configures your shell. Don't forget to automate this as
        described earlier, as it makes life much easier when developing
        OCaml code!

        The <literal>utop</literal> tool provides a convenient
        interactive toplevel, with full command history, command macros
        and module name completion. When you first run
        <literal>utop</literal>, you'll find yourself at an interactive
        prompt with a bar at the bottom of the screen. The bottom bar
        dynamically updates as you write text, and contains the possible
        names of modules or variables that are valid at that point in
        the phrase you are entering. You can press the
        <literal>&lt;tab&gt;</literal> key to complete the phrase with
        the first choice.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>~/.ocamlinit</literal> file in your home directory
        initialises <literal>utop</literal> with common libraries and
        syntax extensions so you don't need to type them in every time.
        Now that you have Core installed, you should update it to load
        it every time you start <literal>utop</literal>, by adding this
        to it:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ocaml">
#use &quot;topfind&quot;
#camlp4o
#require &quot;core.top&quot;
#require &quot;core_extended&quot;
#require &quot;async&quot;
open Core.Std
</programlisting>
      <para>
        When you run <literal>utop</literal> with this initialization
        file, it should start up with Core opened and ready to use.

          You also need to make the <literal>utop.el</literal> file
          available to your Emacs installation. The OPAM version of
          <literal>utop</literal> installs it into the
          <literal>~/.opam</literal> hierarchy, for example in
          <literal>~/.opam/system/share/emacs/site-lisp/utop.el</literal>.

          Eclipse is a popular IDE usually used for Java development.
          The OCaml Development Tools (ODT) project provides equivalent

          automatic compilation and name completion.

  <title>Packaging</title>

    The OCaml toolchain is structured much like a C compiler, with
    several tools that generate intermediate files and finally link
    against a runtime. The final outputs don't have to be just
    executables. Many people embed OCaml code as object files that are
    called from other applications, or even compile it to Javascript and
    other esoteric targets. Let's start by covering some of the standard
    OCaml tools, and then move on to some of the higher level methods
    for packaging and publishing your code online.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="the-ocaml-toolchain">
    <title>The OCaml toolchain</title>
    <para>
      There are two distinct compilers for OCaml code included in the
      standard distribution. The first outputs bytecode that is
      interpreted at runtime, and the second generates fast, efficient
      native code directly. Both of these share the front-end
      type-checking logic, and only diverge when it comes to code
      generation.

      <title>The <literal>ocamlc</literal> bytecode compiler</title>
      <para>
        The simplest code generator is the <literal>ocamlc</literal>
        compiler, which outputs bytecode that is interpreted via the
        <literal>ocamlrun</literal> runtime. The OCaml bytecode virtual
        machine is a stack machine (much like the Java Virtual Machine),
        with the exception of a single register that stores the most
        recent result. This provides a simple runtime model that is easy
        to implement or embed within other systems, but executes rather
        slowly due to being interpreted.
