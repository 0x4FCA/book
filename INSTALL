To build the Docbook, you will need:

* OCaml 4.00.1+
* OPAM http://opam.ocamlpro.com
* Run `opam install core xmlm cmdliner` for building the site.
* You will need `opam install github` for the server side.

To build the HTML site:

The `gen-book.sh` script does the building, and `gen-book.sh -h` will
output help.
