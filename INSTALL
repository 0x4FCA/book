To build the Docbook, you will need:

* OCaml 4.00.1+
* OPAM http://opam.ocamlpro.com
* Install the `core` and `xmlm` packages.

To build the HTML site:
* xsltproc
* Python packages: beautifulsoup4 and django

Just do `make clean && make && make site`, and the HTML will be in
`commenting/en/alpha1/index.html`
