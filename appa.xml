    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>To work through Real World OCaml, you'll need the following software
    packages installed:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><ulink url="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</ulink> version 4.1.0 or
        greater. This book uses some tools that we've developed while writing
        it, and so you need to ensure that you have at least this version
        before trying the examples in the book.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><ulink url="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</ulink> version 1.0 or
        greater. This will give you access to all the OCaml libraries used in
        Real World OCaml.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><ulink url="https://github.com/diml/utop">Utop</ulink> is a
        modern interactive toplevel with command history, tab completion, and
        defaults that are tuned to work with the examples in Real World
        OCaml.</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The easiest way to install OCaml is usually via the binary packages
    available for many operating systems. For day-to-day code development
    however, it's much easier to use a source-code manager that lets you
    modify individual libraries and automatically recompile all the
    dependencies.</para>

    <para>An important difference between OCaml and scripting languages such
    as Python or Ruby is the static type safety that means that you can't just
    mix-and-match compiled libraries. Interfaces are checked when libraries
    are compiled, so when an interface is changed, all the dependent libraries
    must also be recompiled. Source-based package managers such as OPAM
    automate this process for you and make development life much
    easier.</para>

          has all of the example code freely available under a
          public-domain-like license, so that you can copy them for use in
          your own projects.</para>

          contains the HTML documentation for all the libraries used within
          the book. This is a convenient reference for the Core interfaces,
          and also the other third-party software we use such as Yojson or
          Menhir.</para>
