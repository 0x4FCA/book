  
## Exercise
  The expression `input_line stdin` reads a line of text from standard input, returning the line
  as a string, or raising the exception `End_of_file` if the end of the file has been reached.
  Write a function `input_lines` to read all the lines from the channel `stdin`, returning a
  list of all the lines.  The order of the lines in the list does not matter.
