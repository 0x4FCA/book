  
## Exercise
  One could argue that sharing constraints are never necessary for
  unparameterized modules like the ones in this chapter. In the example
  of Figure~\reffigure{xmset8}, there are at least two other solutions
  that allow the `Set2` and `Set`
  modules to share values, without having to use sharing
  constraints. Present two alternate solutions without sharing
  constraints.
