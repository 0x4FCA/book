  
## Exercise
  In Section~\ref{section:objects-factories} the factory functions include some apparently silly field
  definitions.  For example, the function `new_poly` includes the field
  `val vertices = vertices`.
  What is the purpose of the field definition?  What would happen if it were
  omitted?
