  
## Exercise
  In Section~\ref{section:objects-functional-update} we implemented the three factory
  functions `new_scale`, `new_rotate`, and `new_translate` as methods,
  claiming that it would avoid code duplication.  Write one of the factory functions as a normal
  function (not a method).  How can you avoid code duplication?
