  
## Exercise
  You are given two files `a.txt`
  and `b.txt`, each containing a single character.
  Write a function `exchange` to exchange the values in
  the two files.  Your function should be robust to errors (for example,
  if one of the files doesn't exist, or can't be opened).
  
  Is it possible to make the `exchange` operation
  atomic?  That is, if the operation is successful the contents are
  exchanged, but if the operation is unsuccessful the files are left
  unchanged?
