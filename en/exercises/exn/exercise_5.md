  
## Exercise
  The expression \lstinline+input_line stdin+ reads a line of text from standard input, returning the line
  as a string, or raising the exception \lstinline+End_of_file+ if the end of the file has been reached.
  Write a function \lstinline+input_lines+ to read all the lines from the channel \lstinline+stdin+, returning a
  list of all the lines.  The order of the lines in the list does not matter.
