  In the French programmer example, the `programmer` has a
  field `favorite_language` and so does
  the `french_person`.  Can the inheritance hierarchy be
  modified so that these are available
  as `favorite_programming_language`
  and `favorite_natural_language`, without
  modifying the classes `programmer` and `french_person`?
