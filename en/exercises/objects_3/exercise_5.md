  Suppose we have several mutually-recursive functions 
  `$f_1$ : int -> int`, $\ldots$, `$f_n$ : int -> int`
  that we want to define in separate files.  In
  Exercise~\ref{exercise:functor5} we did this with recursive modules.
  Do it with multiple inheritance instead.  Is there any advantage to
  using classes over recursive modules?
