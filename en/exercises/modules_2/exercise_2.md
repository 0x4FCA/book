  In OCaml, programs are usually written ``bottom-up,'' meaning that
  programs are constructed piece-by-piece, and the last function is a
  file is likely to be the most important.  Many programmers prefer a
  top-down style, where the most important functions are defined first
  in a file, and supporting definitions are placed later in the file.
  Can you use the module system to allow top-down programming?
