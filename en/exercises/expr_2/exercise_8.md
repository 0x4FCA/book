  It is known that a welfare crook lives in Los Angeles.  You are given lists for 1) people receiving
  welfare, 2) Hollywood actors, and 3) residents of Beverly Hills.  The names in each list are
  sorted alphabetically (by `<`).  A welfare crook is someone who appears in all three
  lists.  Write an algorithm to find at least one crook.
