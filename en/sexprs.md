# Data Serialization with S-Expressions

We've already shown you how to parse third-party data formats into OCaml in
earlier chapters.   Sometimes though, you just want to quickly convert an OCaml
type to and from a human-readable and editable form in your own code, and not
worry about interoperability.  Core's solution to this problem is to use
*s-expressions*.

S-expressions are nested parenthetical expressions whose atomic values are
strings.  They were first popularized by the Lisp programming language in the
1960s, and have remained one of the simplest and most effective ways to encode
structured data.  There's a full definition of them available
[online](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Sexp.txt).
An example s-expression might look like this.

```frag
((typ scheme)(name sexpr/basic.scm))
```

This chapter will show you:

* how to generate s-expressions from arbitrary OCaml types, thus giving
  you a human-readable format for persisting any values in your code.
* TODO.

## Basics

OCaml values are not directly converted to-and-from s-expression strings.
Instead, the s-expression is built up as a simpler OCaml value, which is later
serialized into strings or memory buffers.  The OCaml type of an s-expression
is quite simple and available from the `Sexp` module within `Core.Std`.

```frag
((typ ocaml)(name sexpr/sexp.mli))
```

An s-expression can be thought of as a tree where each node contains a list of
its children, and where the leaves of the tree are strings.

The `Sexp` module in Core also comes with functionality for parsing and
printing s-expressions.

```frag
((typ ocamltop)(name sexpr/print_sexp.topscript))
```

In addition, most of the base types in Core support conversion to and
from s-expressions.  For example, we can write:

```frag
((typ ocamltop)(name sexpr/to_from_sexp.topscript))
```

Notice that `List.sexp_of_t` is polymorphic, and takes as its first
argument another conversion function to handle the elements of the
list to be converted.  Core uses this scheme more generally for
defining sexp-converters for polymorphic types.

<note>
<title>Toplevel printing</title>

You may have noticed that the values of the s-expressions that we created above
were actually printed properly in the toplevel, instead of as the raw tree of
`Atom` and `List` variants that they're actually made of.

This is due to OCaml's facility for installing custom *toplevel printers*
that can rewrite some values into more toplevel-friendly equivalents.  They
are generally installed as `ocamlfind` packages ending in `top`.

```frag
((typ console)(name sexpr/list_top_packages.out))
```

The `core.top` package (which you should have loaded by default in your
`.ocamlinit` file) loads in printers for the Core extensions already, so
you don't need to do anything special to use the Sexplib printer.

</note>

### Generating s-expressions from OCaml types

But what if you want a function to convert some brand new type to an
s-expression?  You can of course write it yourself manually:

```frag
((typ ocamltop)(name sexpr/manually_making_sexp.topscript))
```

This is somewhat tiresome to write, and it gets more so when you consider the
parser, _i.e._, `t_of_sexp`, which is considerably more complex.  Writing this
kind of parsing and printing code by hand is mechanical and error prone, not to
mention a drag.

Given how mechanical the code is, you could imagine writing a program that
inspected the type definition and autogenerated the conversion code for you.
As it turns out, we can do just that using `Sexplib`.  The `Sexplib` package,
which is included with Core, provides both a library for manipulating
s-expressions and a syntax extension for generating such conversion functions.
With that syntax extension enabled, any type that has `with sexp` as an
annotation will trigger the generation of the functions we want for free.

```frag
((typ ocamltop)(name sexpr/auto_making_sexp.topscript))
```

The `with sexp` is detected by a `Sexplib` syntax extension and replaced with
the extra conversion functions you see above.  The syntax extensions in Core
almost all have this same basic structure: they autogenerate code based on type
definitions, implementing functionality that you could in theory have
implemented by hand, but with far less programmer effort.

<note>
<title>The `camlp4` preprocessor and `type_conv`</title>

OCaml doesn't directly support converting static type definitions to
and from other data formats.  Instead, it supplies a powerful syntax
extension mechanism known as `camlp4`.  This lets you extend the
grammar of the language to mark types as requiring special action, and
then mechanically generate boilerplate code over those types (such as
converting to and from other data formats).

Many of the examples in the book depend on `camlp4`, but the examples all
invoke it automatically for you via the `core.syntax` OCamlfind package.
We explain the preprocessor in more detail in [xref](#the-compiler-frontend-parsing-and-type-checking).

</note>

## The Sexp format

The textual representation of s-expressions is pretty
straightforward. An s-expression is written down as a nested
parenthetical expression, with whitespace-separated strings as the
atoms.  Quotes are used for atoms that contain parentheses or spaces
themselves; backslash is the escape character; and semicolons are used
to introduce single-line comments.  Thus, the following file,
`example.scm`:

```frag
((typ scheme)(name sexpr/example.scm))
```

can be loaded using sexplib.  As you can see, the commented data is
not part of the resulting s-expression.

```frag
((typ ocamltop)(name sexpr/example_load.topscript)(part 0))
```

All in, the s-expression format actually supports three comment
syntaxes:

- `;`, which comments out everything to the end of a line
- `#|` and `|#`, which are delimiters for commenting out a block
- `#;`, which comments out the first complete s-expression that follows.

The following example shows all of these in action.

```frag
((typ scheme)(name sexpr/comment_heavy.scm))
```

Again, loading the file as an s-expression drops the comments.

```frag
((typ ocamltop)(name sexpr/example_load.topscript)(part 1))
```

Note that the comments were dropped from the file upon reading.  This is
expected, since there's no place in the `Sexp.t` type to store comments.

If we introduce an error into our s-expression, by, say, deleting the
open-paren in front of `bar`, we'll get a parse error:

```frag
((typ ocamltop)(name sexpr/example_load.topscript)(part 2))
```

In the above, we use `Exn.handle_uncaught` to make sure that the exception gets
printed out in full detail.  You should generally wrap every Core program in
this handler to get good error messages for any unexpected exceptions.

## Sexp converters

The most important functionality provided by Sexplib is the auto-generation of
converters for new types.  We've seen a bit of how this works already, but
let's walk through a complete example.  Here's the source for the beginning of
a library for representing integer intervals.

```frag
((typ ocaml)(name sexpr/int_interval.ml))
```

We can now use this module as follows.

```frag
((typ ocaml)(name sexpr/test_interval.ml))
```

But we're still missing something: we haven't created an `mli`
signature for `Int_interval` yet.  Note that we need to explicitly
export the s-expression converters that were created within the ml.
If we don't:

```ocaml
(* file: int_interval.mli *)
(* Module for representing closed integer intervals *)

type t

val is_empty : t -> bool
val create : int -> int -> t
val contains : t -> int -> bool
```

then we'll get the following error:

```
File "test_interval.ml", line 15, characters 20-42:
Error: Unbound value Int_interval.sexp_of_t
Command exited with code 2.
```

We could export the types by hand in the signature:

```ocaml
type t
val sexp_of_t : Sexp.t -> t
val t_of_sexp : t -> Sexp.t
```

But Sexplib has a shorthand for this as well, so that we can just use
the same `with` shorthand in the `mli`.

```ocaml
type t with sexp
```

at which point `test_interval.ml` will compile again, and if we run
it, we'll get the following output:

```
$ ./test_interval.native
((Range 3 4) Empty (Range 2 3) (Range 1 6))
```

### Preserving invariants

One easy mistake to make when dealing with sexp converters is to
ignore the fact that those converters can violate the invariants of
your code.  For example, the `Int_interval` module depends for the
correctness of the `is_empty` check on the fact that for any value
`Range (x,y)`, `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.  The `create`
function preserves this invariant, but the `t_of_sexp` function does
not.

We can fix this problem by overriding the autogenerated function and
writing a custom sexp-converter that is based on the autogenerated
converter.

```ocaml
type t = | Range of int * int
         | Empty
with sexp

let create x y = if x > y then Empty else Range (x,y)

let t_of_sexp sexp =
  let t = t_of_sexp sexp in
  begin match t with
  | Empty -> ()
  | Range (x,y) ->
    if y < x then of_sexp_error "Upper and lower bound of Range swapped" sexp
  end;
  t
```

This trick of overriding an existing function definition with a new
one is perfectly acceptable in OCaml.  Function definitions are only
recursive if the `rec` keyword is specified, and so in this case the
inner `t_of_sexp` call will go to the earlier autogenerated definition
that resulted from the `type t with sexp` definition.

We call the function `of_sexp_error` to raise an exception because
that improves the error reporting that Sexplib can provide when a
conversion fails.

### Getting good error messages

There are two steps to deserializing a type from an s-expression:
first, converting the bytes in a file to an s-expression, and the
second, converting that s-expression into the type in question.  One
problem with this is that it can be hard to localize errors to the
right place using this scheme.  Consider the following example:

```ocaml
(* file: read_foo.ml *)

open Core.Std

type t = { a: string; b: int; c: float option } with sexp

let run () =
  let t =
    Sexp.load_sexp "example.scm"
    |> t_of_sexp
  in
  printf "b is: %d\n%!" t.b

let () =
  Exn.handle_uncaught ~exit:true run
```

If you were to run this on a malformatted file, say, this one:

```
;; example.scm
((a not-an-integer)
 (b not-an-integer)
 (c ()))
```

you'll get the following error:

```
read_foo $ ./read_foo.native
Uncaught exception:

  (Sexplib.Conv.Of_sexp_error
   (Failure "int_of_sexp: (Failure int_of_string)") not-an-integer)
```

If all you have is the error message and the string, it's not terribly
informative.  In particular, you know that the parsing error-ed out on
the atom "not-an-integer", but you don't know which one!  In a large
file, this kind of bad error message can be pure misery.

But there's hope!  If we make small change to the `run` function as
follows:

```ocaml
let run () =
  let t = Sexp.load_sexp_conv_exn "example.scm" t_of_sexp in
  printf "b is: %d\n%!" t.b
```

and run it again, we'll get the following much more helpful error
message:

```ocaml
read_foo $ ./read_foo.native
Uncaught exception:

  (Sexplib.Conv.Of_sexp_error
   (Sexplib.Sexp.Annotated.Conv_exn example.scm:3:4
    (Failure "int_of_sexp: (Failure int_of_string)"))
   not-an-integer)
```

In the above error, "example.scm:3:4" tells us that the error occurred on
"example.scm", line 3, character 4, which is a much better start for
figuring out what has gone wrong.

## Sexp-conversion directives

Sexplib supports a collection of directives for modifying the default
behavior of the autogenerated sexp-converters.  These directives allow
you to customize the way in which types are represented as
s-expressions without having to write a custom parser.

### `sexp_opaque`

The most commonly used directive is `sexp_opaque`, whose purpose is to
mark a given component of a type as being unconvertible.  Anything
marked with `sexp_opaque` will be presented as the atom `<opaque>` by
the to-sexp converter, and will trigger an exception from the
from-sexp converter.

Note that the type of a component marked as opaque doesn't need to have a
sexp-converter defined.  Here, if we define a type without a sexp-converter,
and then try to use another type with a sexp-converter, we'll error out:

```ocaml
# type no_converter = int * int;;
type no_converter = int * int
# type t = { a: no_converter; b: string } with sexp;;
Characters 14-26:
  type t = { a: no_converter; b: string } with sexp;;
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: Unbound value no_converter_of_sexp
```

But with `sexp_opaque`, we won't:

```ocaml
# type t = { a: no_converter sexp_opaque; b: string } with sexp;;
type t = { a : no_converter Core.Std.sexp_opaque; b : string; }
val t_of_sexp__ : Sexplib.Sexp.t -> t = <fun>
val t_of_sexp : Sexplib.Sexp.t -> t = <fun>
val sexp_of_t : t -> Sexplib.Sexp.t = <fun>
```

And if we now convert a value of this type to an s-expression, we'll
see the contents of field `a` marked as opaque:

```ocaml
# sexp_of_t { a = (3,4); b = "foo" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a <opaque>) (b foo))
```

### `sexp_list`

Sometimes, sexp-converters have more parentheses than one would
ideally like.  Consider, for example, the following variant type:

```ocaml
# type compatible_versions = | Specific of string list
                             | All
  with sexp;;
# sexp_of_compatible_versions (Specific ["3.12.0"; "3.12.1"; "3.13.0"]);;
- : Sexp.t = (Specific (3.12.0 3.12.1 3.13.0))
```

You might prefer to make the syntax a bit less parenthesis-laden by
dropping the parentheses around the list.  `sexp_list` gives us this
alternate syntax:

```ocaml
# type compatible_versions = | Specific of string sexp_list
                             | All
  with sexp;;
# sexp_of_compatible_versions (Specific ["3.12.0"; "3.12.1"; "3.13.0"]);;
- : Sexp.t = (Specific 3.12.0 3.12.1 3.13.0)
```

### `sexp_option`

Another common directive is `sexp_option`, which is used to to make a
record field optional in the s-expression.  Normally, optional values
are represented either as `()` for `None`, or as `(x)` for `Some x`,
and a record field containing an option would be rendered accordingly.
For example:

```ocaml
# type t = { a: int option; b: string } with sexp;;
# sexp_of_t { a = None; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a ()) (b hello))
# sexp_of_t { a = Some 3; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a (3)) (b hello))
```

But what if we want a field to be optional, _i.e._, we want to allow
it to be omitted from the record entirely?  In that case, we can mark
it with `sexp_option`:

```ocaml
# type t = { a: int sexp_option; b: string } with sexp;;
# sexp_of_t { a = Some 3; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((a 3) (b hello))
# sexp_of_t { a = None; b = "hello" };;
- : Sexp.t = ((b hello))
```

### Specifying defaults

The `sexp_option` declaration is really just an example of how one
might want to deal with default values.  With `sexp_option`, your type
on the OCaml side is an option, with `None` representing the case
where no value is provided.  But you might want to allow other ways of
filling in default values.

Consider the following type which represents the configuration of a
very simple web-server.

```ocaml
# type http_server_config = {
     web_root: string;
     port: int;
     addr: string;
  } with sexp;;
```

One could imagine making some of these parameters optional; in particular, by
default, we might want the web server to bind to port 80, and to listen as
localhost.  The sexp-syntax allows this as follows.

```ocaml
# type http_server_config = {
     web_root: string;
     port: int with default(80);
     addr: string with default("localhost");
  } with sexp;;
```

The top-level will echo back the type you just defined as usual, but also
generate some additional conversion functions.

```ocaml
type http_server_config = { web_root : string; port : int; addr : string; }
val http_server_config_of_sexp__ : Sexplib.Sexp.t -> http_server_config =
  <fun>
val http_server_config_of_sexp : Sexplib.Sexp.t -> http_server_config = <fun>
val sexp_of_http_server_config : http_server_config -> Sexplib.Sexp.t = <fun>
```

These new functions let you convert to and from s-expressions.

```ocaml
# http_server_config_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "((web_root /var/www/html))";;
# let cfg =
  http_server_config_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "((web_root /var/www/html))");;
val cfg : http_server_config =
  {web_root = "/var/www/html"; port = 80; addr = "localhost"}
```

When we convert the configuration back out to an s-expression, you'll notice
that no data is dropped.

```ocaml
# sexp_of_http_server_config cfg;;
- : Sexplib.Sexp.t = ((web_root /var/www/html) (port 80) (addr localhost))
```

We could make the generated s-expression also drop exported values, by
using the `sexp_drop_default` directive.

```ocaml
# type http_server_config = {
     web_root: string;
     port: int with default(80), sexp_drop_default;
     addr: string with default("localhost"), sexp_drop_default;
  } with sexp;;
type http_server_config = { web_root : string; port : int; addr : string; }
val http_server_config_of_sexp__ : Sexplib.Sexp.t -> http_server_config =
  <fun>
val http_server_config_of_sexp : Sexplib.Sexp.t -> http_server_config = <fun>
val sexp_of_http_server_config : http_server_config -> Sexplib.Sexp.t = <fun>
# let cfg = http_server_config_of_sexp (Sexp.of_string "((web_root /var/www/html))");;
val cfg : http_server_config =
  {web_root = "/var/www/html"; port = 80; addr = "localhost"}
# sexp_of_http_server_config cfg;;
- : Sexplib.Sexp.t = ((web_root /var/www/html))
```

As you can see, the fields that are at their default values are simply
omitted from the s-expression.  On the other hand, if we convert a
config with other values, then those values will be included in the
s-expression.

```ocaml
# sexp_of_http_server_config { cfg with port = 8080 };;
- : Sexplib.Sexp.t = ((web_root /var/www/html) (port 8080))
# sexp_of_http_server_config { cfg with port = 8080; addr = "192.168.0.1" };;
- : Sexplib.Sexp.t =
((web_root /var/www/html) (port 8080) (addr 192.168.0.1))
```

This can be very useful in designing config file formats that are both
reasonably terse and easy to generate and maintain.  It can also be
useful for backwards compatibility: if you add a new field to your
config record, but you make that field optional, then you should still
be able to parse older version of your config.
