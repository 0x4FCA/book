    <title>Language Concepts</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>Part I covers the basic language concepts you'll need to know when
      building OCaml programs. You won't need to memorise all of this
      (objects, for example, are used rarely in practice) but understanding
      the concepts and examples is important.</para>

      <para>This part opens up with a guided tour to give you a quick overview
      of the language using an interactive command-line interface. It then
      moves onto covering language features such as records, algebraic data
      types and the module system.</para>

      <para>The final portion covers more advanced features such as functors,
      objects and first-class modules, which may all take some time to digest.
      Persevere though; even though these concepts may be difficult at first,
      they will put you in good stead even when switching to other languages,
      many of which have drawn inspiration from ML.</para>
