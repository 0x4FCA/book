  <title>Language Concepts</title>

  <partintro>
    <para>Part I covers the basic language concepts you'll need to know when
    building OCaml programs. You won't need to memorize all of this (objects,
    for example, are used rarely in practice), but understanding the concepts
    and examples is important.</para>

    <para>This part opens up with a guided tour to give you a quick overview
    of the language using an interactive, command-line interface. It then
    moves onto covering language features such as records, algebraic data
    types, and the module system.</para>

    <para>The final portion covers more advanced features such as functors,
    objects, and first-class modules, which may all take some time to digest.
    Persevere though; even though these concepts may be difficult at first,
    they will put you in good stead even when switching to other languages,
    many of which have drawn inspiration from ML.</para>
