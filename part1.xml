  <title>Language Concepts</title>

  <partintro>
    <para>Part I covers the basic language concepts you'll need to know when building OCaml
      programs. It opens up with a guided tour to give you a quick overview of the language using an
      interactive command-line interface. The subsequent chapters cover the material that is touched
      upon by the tour in much more detail, including detailed coverage of OCaml's approach to
      imperative programming.</para>

    <para>The last few chapters introduce OCaml's powerful abstraction facilities. We start by using
      functors to build a library for programming with intervals, and then use first-class modules
      to build a type-safe plugin system. OCaml also supports object-oriented programming, and we
      close Part I with two chapters that cover the object system; the first showing how to use
      OCaml's objects directly, and the second showing how to use the class system to add more
      advanced features like inheritance. This description comes together in the design of a simple
      object-oriented graphics library.</para>
