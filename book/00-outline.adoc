== About the Book ==

OCaml is a modern functional programming language with strong typing,
fast native code output, automatic type inference and a wide array of
mature libraries. This book introduces the basics of the language and
how to set up a development environment, and includes recipes for many
real-world tasks using the Core standard library. It also covers more
advanced topics such as the module system, foreign-function interface,
macro language and the ocamlbuild system.

The book is aimed at the working programmer interested in using OCaml
to solve day-to-day problems such as data processing, numerical
computation, system scripting, or database-driven web applications.
OCaml blends imperative, functional and object-oriented programming
styles in one language, making it a pragmatic and fun choice for
writing fast, succinct and readable systems code.
