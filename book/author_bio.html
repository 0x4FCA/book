    <h1>About the Author(s)</h1>

    <p>Yaron Minsky heads the technology group at Jane Street, a
    proprietary trading firm that is the largest industrial user of
    OCaml. He was responsible for introducing OCaml to the company
    and for managing the company's transition to using OCaml for
    all of its core infrastructure. Today, billions of dollars
    worth of securities transactions flow each day through those
    systems. Yaron obtained his PhD in Computer Science from
    Cornell University, where he studied distributed systems. Yaron
    has lectured, blogged, and written about OCaml for years, with
    articles published in <em>Communications of the ACM</em> and
    the <em>Journal of Functional Programming</em>. He chairs the
    steering committee of the Commercial Users of Functional
    Programming, and is a member of the steering committee for the
    International Conference on Functional Programming.</p>

    <p>Anil Madhavapeddy is a senior research fellow at the
    University of Cambridge, based in the Systems Research Group.
    He was on the original team that developed the Xen hypervisor,
    and he helped develop an industry-leading cloud management
    toolstack written entirely in OCaml. This XenServer product has
    been deployed on hundreds of thousands of physical hosts and
    drives critical infrastructure for many Fortune 500 companies.
    Prior to obtaining his PhD in 2006 from the University of
    Cambridge, Anil had a diverse background in industry at Network
    Appliance, NASA, and Internet Vision. In addition to
    professional and academic activities, he is an active member of
    the open source development community with the OpenBSD
    operating system, is co-chair of the Commercial Uses of
    Functional Programming workshop, and serves on the boards of
    startup companies such as Ashima Arts, where OCaml is
    extensively used.</p>

    <p>Jason Hickey is a software engineer at Google Inc. in
    Mountain View, California. He is part of the team that designs
    and develops the global computing infrastructure used to
    support Google services, including the software systems for
    managing and scheduling massively distributed computing
    resources. Prior to joining Google, Jason was an assistant
    professor of computer science at Caltech, where his research
    was in reliable and fault-tolerant computing systems, including
    programming language design, formal methods, compilers, and new
    models of distributed computation. He obtained his PhD in
    computer science from Cornell University, where he studied
    programming languages. He is the author of the MetaPRL system,
    a logical framework for design and analysis of large software
    systems; and OMake, an advanced build system for large software
    projects. He is also the author of the textbook <em>An
    Introduction to Objective Caml</em> (unpublished).</p>
