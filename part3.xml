    <title>The Runtime System</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>Part III is all about understanding the compiler toolchain and
      runtime system in OCaml. It's a remarkably simple system in comparison
      to other language runtimes (such as Java or the .NET CLR).</para>

      <para>You'll need to read this to build very high performance systems
      that have to minimise resource usage or interface to C libraries. This
      is also where we talk about profiling and debugging techniques using
      tools such as GNU gdb.</para>
