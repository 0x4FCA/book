Adding or modifying a chapter require a few steps:

1) Add the filename to `chapters.en`

2) Edit scripts/add_parts.ml to add the chapter id (which is the lowercase
version of the filename with spaces replaced by dashes) to the OCaml program.

If there are any orphan chapters found which aren't in `add_parts.ml`, the
script should abort with a failure until you add it.
