  <para>The animal on the cover of <emphasis>Real World OCaml</emphasis> is the Bactrian camel
      (<emphasis>Camelus bactrianus</emphasis>). The Bactrian camel, one of two species of camel, is
    native to Central Asia and has been used domestically in the area for thousands of years. Even
    though there are over two million domesticated Bactrian camels, only about a thousand are
    considered wild.</para>
  <para>The Bactrian camel is a large animal at 6 to 7.5 feet in height and 7.4 to 11.5 feet in
    length. An adult will typically weigh between 660 and 2,200 pounds. The Bactrian camel is
    distinctive for its two large humps on their back, hefty wooly coat, and dark brown color. It is
    a herbivore that will eat all kinds of vegetation, though they have been known to feed on dead
    animals. </para>
  <para>Humans have domesticated the Bactrian camel for travel purposes because of its great natural
    resiliency. For example, the Bactrian camel can thrive in habitats of both extreme cold and
    heat. It can also go without water for months and when water is available it can consume up to
    55 litres. </para>
