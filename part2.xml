    <title>Tools and Techniques</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>Part II builds on the basics by working through higher-level tools
      and techniques for using OCaml effectively. Here you'll learn about
      useful libraries for building command-line interfaces and networked
      applications, as well as functional design patterns that help combine
      different features of the language to good effect.</para>

      <para>The focus throughout this section is on networked systems, and
      among other examples we'll build a simple tool that will perform
      Internet queries using the DuckDuckGo search engine.</para>
