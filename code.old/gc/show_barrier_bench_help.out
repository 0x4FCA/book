$ ./barrier_bench.native -help
Benchmark for mutable, immutable

  barrier_bench.native [COLUMN ...]

Columns that can be specified are:
	name       - Name of the test.
	cycles     - Number of CPU cycles (RDTSC) taken.
	cycles-err - 95% confidence interval and R^2 error for cycles.
	~cycles    - Cycles taken excluding major GC costs.
	time       - Number of nano secs taken.
	time-err   - 95% confidence interval and R^2 error for time.
	~time      - Time (ns) taken excluding major GC costs.
	alloc      - Allocation of major, minor and promoted words.
	gc         - Show major and minor collections per 1000 runs.
	percentage - Relative execution time as a percentage.
	speedup    - Relative execution cost as a speedup.
	samples    - Number of samples collected for profiling.

R^2 error indicates how noisy the benchmark data is. A value of
1.0 means the amortized cost of benchmark is almost exactly predicated
and 0.0 means the reported values are not reliable at all.

Major and Minor GC stats indicate how many collections happen per 1000
runs of the benchmarked function.

The following columns will be displayed by default:
	+name time percentage

To specify that a column should be displayed only if it has a non-trivial value,
prefix the column name with a '+'.

=== flags ===

  [-clear-columns]     Don't display default columns. Only show user specified
                       ones.
  [-display STYLE]     Table style (short, tall, line or blank). Default short.
  [-geometric SCALE]   Use geometric sampling. (default 1.01)
  [-linear INCREMENT]  Use linear sampling to explore number of runs, example 1.
  [-no-compactions]    Disable GC compactions.
  [-quota SECS]        Time quota allowed per test (default 10s).
  [-save]              Save benchmark data to <test name>.txt files.
  [-stabilize-gc]      Stabilize GC between each sample capture.
  [-v]                 High verbosity level.
  [-width WIDTH]       width limit on column display (default 150).
  [-build-info]        print info about this build and exit
  [-version]           print the version of this build and exit
  [-help]              print this help text and exit
                       (alias: -?)
