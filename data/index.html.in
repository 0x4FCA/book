                <p>Welcome to the online version of the Real World OCaml website.  The book is currently under heavy development, and this site provides a
                   place for proof-readers to give us online comments of the book.</p>
                <p>We are developing the book via a series of <i>milestones</i> which have completed chapters that are ready for review.  Each milestone
                   is a standalone HTML version of the book.  We can provide an O'Reilly PDF copy on request for a given milestone.</p>
                <h2>Github</h2>
                <p>To login and view the book, you will need a free <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> id to authenticate with.  When you visit a 
                   book milestone, it has a <i>login via Github</i> button on the bottom-left of the menu.  When you login, you temporarily grant us
                   access to look at your public repositories.  However, we do not store your authorization tokens on the server side, and instead use
                   a cookie on your browser.  To log out, you simply delete the cookie <i>(TODO: we will modify our HTML to have a logout button)</i>.</p>
                <p>Once you have authenticated, you will see that every paragraph has a comments link beside it.  Simply enter your feedback
                   in there, and a Github issue will automatically be created on your behalf.  We will follow up via e-mail that you will receive through
                   Github, thus ensuring that all feedback can be tracked and dealt with easily.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about all this, please get in touch with <a href="mailto:anil@recoil.org">Anil</a>.
