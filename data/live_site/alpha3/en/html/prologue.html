      The programming languages that you use affect your productivity.
      They affect how reliable your software is, how efficient it is,
      how easy it is to read, to refactor, and to extend. And the
      languages you know and use can deeply affect how you think about
      programming and software design.
    </p><p id="idp5284272">
      But not all ideas about how to design a programming language are
      created equal. Over the last 40 years, a few key language features
      have emerged that together form a kind of sweet-spot in language
      design. These features include:
    </p><ul><li><p id="idp4560752">
<span><em>Garbage collection</em></span> for automatic memory
          management, now a feature of almost every modern high-level
          language.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp4461072">
<span><em>Higher-order functions</em></span> that can be passed
          around as first-class values, and seen in Javascript or Scala.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp5506688">
<span><em>Static type-checking</em></span> to reduce run-time
          errors, such as Java class interfaces or Objective-C methods.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp4433680">
<span><em>Generics</em></span> to enable abstractions to be
          constructed across different datatypes, available in Java and
          .NET.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp4097968">
<span><em>Immutable data structures</em></span> that cannot be
          destructively updated, famously enforced in Haskell but also a
          common feature of many distributed big data frameworks.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp3384496">
<span><em>Algebraic datatypes</em></span> and pattern matching
          to describe values more precisely, available in Miranda, F#
          and Standard ML.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp4510768">
<span><em>Automatic type inference</em></span> to avoid having
          to laboriously define the type of every single variable in a
          program and have it inferred based on how a value is used.
        </p></li></ul><p id="idp5103120">
      Some of you will know and love these features, and others will be
      completely new to them. Most of you will have seen
      <span><em>some</em></span> of them in other languages that you've
      used. As we'll demonstrate over the course of this book, it turns
      out that there is something transformative about having them all
      together and able to interact in a single language. Despite their
      importance, these ideas have made only limited inroads into
      mainstream languages. And when they do arrive there, like
      higher-order functions in C# or parametric polymorphism in Java,
      it's typically in a limited and awkward form. The only languages
      that support these ideas well are statically-typed functional
      programming languages like OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala and
      Standard-ML.
    </p><p id="idp1873584">
      Among this worthy set of languages, OCaml stands apart because it
      manages to provide a great deal of power while remaining highly
      pragmatic, highly performant, and comparatively simple to use and
      understand. It is this that makes OCaml a great choice for
      programmers who want to step up to a better programming language,
      and at the same time want to get practical work done.
    </p><section><h1 id="the-core-standard-library">The Core Standard Library</h1><p id="idp3362928">
        A language on its own isn't enough. You also need a rich set of
        libraries to base your applications on. A common source of
        frustration for those learning OCaml is that the standard
        library that ships with the OCaml compiler is not ideal. While
        it's well implemented, it is really intended for use within the
        compiler itself, and covers only a small subset of the
        functionality you expect for more general-purpose use.
      </p><p id="idp3362288">
        But all is not lost! There is an effective alternative to the
        OCaml standard library called Core. Jane Street, a company that
        has been using OCaml for more than a decade, developed Core for
        its own internal use, but it was designed from the start with an
        eye towards being a general-purpose standard library. Core is
        also distributed with syntax extensions which provide essential
        new functionality to OCaml; and there are additional libraries
        such as the <code>Async</code> network communications
        library that provide even more useful functionality.
      </p></section><section><h1 id="the-ocaml-platform">The OCaml Platform</h1><p id="idp4400800">
        Core is a very comprehensive standard library, but there's also
        a large community of programmers who have used OCaml since its
        first release in 1996. In Real World OCaml, we'll also introduce
        some of these libraries for you to experiment with realistic
        examples. The installation and management of these third-party
        libraries is made much easier via a package management tool
        known as OPAM. We'll explain more about OPAM as the book
        unfolds, but it forms the basis of the Platform, which is a set
        of tools and libraries that, along with the OCaml compiler, let
        you build realistic applications quickly and effectively.
      </p><p id="idp4646144">
        Another big improvement over the standard library is the
        <code>utop</code> interactive top level. This is a modern
        interactive tool that supports command history, macro expansion,
        module completion, and other niceties that make it much more
        pleasant to work with the language. We'll be using
        <code>utop</code> throughout the book instead of the
        normal OCaml toplevel. It can, of course, be installed using
        OPAM, and <a href="installation.html">AppendixÂ A, <i>Installation</i></a> guides you
        through that that process.
      </p></section></section><section><h1 id="about-this-book">About this book</h1><p id="idp249424">
      Real World OCaml is aimed at programmers who have some experience
      with conventional programming languages, but not specifically with
      <span><em>statically typed functional programming</em></span>. The
      world of dynamic scripting languages such as Javascript, Ruby and
      Python have all adopted healthy elements of functional
      programming, but not all of it. Real World OCaml takes you through
      the full lifecycle of how to construct software with static
      typing, including the powerful module system that makes code
      re-use so much more robust.
    </p><p id="idp250816">
      At the same time, OCaml is not Haskell. It takes a much more
      pragmatic approach by being strictly evaluated by default, and
      permitting arbitrary side-effects. In fact, you can write OCaml
      code that looks very similar to C, but is still type-safe. One of
      the major strengths of OCaml for systems programming is that, with
      some experience, you can predict the runtime behaviour of a block
      of code very easily, with very little compiler magic involved.
    </p><p id="idp252208">
      If you've learnt some OCaml before, this book may surprise you
      with some differences from your past experience. The Core standard
      library redefines most of the standard modules to be much more
      consistent, and so you'll need to adapt older code. We believe the
      Core model is worth learning; it's been successfully used on large
      million line codebases, and removes a big barrier to more
      widespread OCaml adoption. There will always exist code that uses
      only the compiler standard library of course, but there are other
      online resources available to learn that. Real World OCaml focuses
      on the techniques the authors have used in their personal
      experience to construct scalable, robust computer systems.
    </p></section><section><h1 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h1><p id="idp5260528">
      Real World OCaml is split into three parts and appendices:
    </p><ul><li><p id="idp5261424">
          Part I covers the basic concepts you'll need to know when
          building OCaml programs. You won't need to memorise all of
          this (objects, for example, are used rarely in practise), but
          understanding the concepts and examples is important. This
          part opens up with a guided tour to give you a quick overview
          of the language. It then moves onto modules, functors and
          objects, which may take some time to digest. Persevere though;
          even thought these concepts may be difficult at first, they
          will put you in good stead even when switching to other
          languages, many of which have drawn inspiration from ML.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp5262912">
          Part II builds on the basics to construct more complete
          examples. This is where you'll pick up some useful techniques
          for building networked systems, as well as some functional
          design patterns that glue together OCaml language elements in
          useful ways. The theme throughout this chapter is on networked
          systems, and we build a running example that will perform
          Internet queries using the DuckDuckGo search engine.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp5264192">
          Part III is all about understanding the runtime system in
          OCaml. It's a remarkably simple system in comparison to other
          language runtimes (such as Java or the .NET CLR), and you'll
          need to read this to build very high performance systems that
          have to minimise resource usage or interface to C libraries.
          This is also where we talk about profiling and debugging
          techniques using tools such as GNU <code>gdb</code> and
          <code>gprof</code>. Contributing your code back to the
          community is also important (if only to get bug fixes from
          other people!), and this part also explains how to do this via
          OPAM and Github.
        </p></li></ul><aside class="note"><h1>
    Note to reviewers
    </h1><p id="idp5267600">
      Real World OCaml uses some tools that we've developed while
      writing this book. Some of these resulted in improvements to the
      OCaml compiler, which means that you will need to ensure that you
      have an up-to-date development environment (using the 4.01.0
      compiler). We've automated everything you need via the OPAM
      package manager, so please do follow the installation instructions
      in <a href="installation.html">AppendixÂ A, <i>Installation</i></a> carefully.
    </p><p id="idp252592">
      At this stage, the Windows operating system is also unsupported,
      and only MacOS X, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD can be expected to
      work reliably. We realize this is a concern; there are no
      fundamental barriers to Windows support, but we're focussed on
      getting the main content finished before getting stuck into the
      porting effort.
