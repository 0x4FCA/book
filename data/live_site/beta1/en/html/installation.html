    <p id="idp12649280">
    The easiest way to use OCaml is via the binary packages available
    for many operating systems. For day-to-day code development however,
    it's much easier to use a source-code manager that lets you modify
    individual libraries and automatically recompile all the
    dependencies.
  </p><p id="idp12649984">
    An important difference between OCaml and scripting languages such
    as Python or Ruby is the static type safety that means that you
    can't just mix-and-match compiled libraries. Interfaces are checked
    when libraries are compiled, so when an interface is changed, all
    the dependent libraries must also be recompiled. Source-based
    package managers automate this process for you and make development
    life much easier.
  </p><p id="idp12650832">
    To work through Real World OCaml, you'll need three major components
    installed:
  </p><ul><li><p id="idp12651840">
        The OCaml compiler itself.
      </p></li><li><p id="idp12652672">
        The OPAM source package manager, through which we'll install
        several extra libraries.
      </p></li><li><p id="idp12653568">
        The <code>utop</code> interactive toplevel, a modern
        interactive toplevel with command history and tab completion.
      </p></li></ul><p id="idp12655056">
    Let's get started with how to install OCaml on various operating
    systems, and we'll get OPAM and <code>utop</code> running
    after that.
  </p><section><h1 id="getting-ocaml">Getting OCaml</h1><p id="idp12657408">
      The OCaml compiler is available as a binary distribution on many
      operating systems. This is the simplest and preferred installation
      route, but we'll also describe how to do a manual installation as
      a last resort.
    </p><section><h1 id="mac-os-x">Mac OS X</h1><p id="idp12659200">
        The
        <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew" target="_top">Homebrew</a>
        package manager has an OCaml installer, which is usually updated
        pretty quickly to the latest stable release. Make sure that you
        have the latest XCode (and Command Line Tools for XCode)
        installed from the App Store before starting the OCaml
        installation.
      </p><pre id="idp12660640">
$ brew install ocaml
$ brew install pcre
</pre><p id="idp12661360">
        The Perl-compatible Regular Expression library (PCRE) is used by
        the Core suite. It's not strictly needed to use OCaml, but is a
        commonly used library that we're installing now to save time
        later.
      </p><p id="idp12662000">
        Another popular package manager on Mac OS X is
        <a href="http://macports.org" target="_top">MacPorts</a>, which also
        has an OCaml port. As with Homebrew, make sure you have XCode
        installed and have followed the rest of the MacPorts
        installation instructions, and then type in:
      </p><pre id="idp12663376">
$ sudo port install ocaml
$ sudo port install ocaml-pcre
</pre></section><section><h1 id="debian-linux">Debian Linux</h1><p id="idp12665392">
        On Debian Linux, you should install OCaml via binary packages.
        You'll need at least OCaml version 3.12.1 to bootstrap OPAM,
        which means using Debian Wheezy or greater. Don't worry about
        getting the absolute latest version of the compiler, as you just
        need one new enough to compile the OPAM package manager, after
        which you'll use OPAM to manage your compiler installation.
      </p><pre id="idp12666224">
$ sudo apt-get install ocaml ocaml-native-compilers camlp4-extra
$ sudo apt-get install git libpcre3-dev curl build-essential m4
</pre><p id="idp12667024">
        Notice that we've installed a few more packages than just the
        OCaml compiler here. The second command line installs enough
        system packages to let you build your own OCaml packages. You
        may find that some OCaml libraries require more system libraries
        (for example, <code>libssl-dev</code>), but we'll
        highlight these in the book when we introduce the library.
      </p></section><section><h1 id="fedora-and-red-hat">Fedora and Red Hat</h1><p id="idp12669792">
        OCaml has been included in the basic distribution since Fedora
        8. To install the latest compiler, just run:
      </p><pre id="idp12670320">
# yum install ocaml
# yum install pcre-devel
</pre><p id="idp12671040">
        The PCRE package is used by Core and is just included here for
        convenience later.
      </p></section><section><h1 id="arch-linux">Arch Linux</h1><p id="idp12672720">
        Arch Linux provides OCaml 4.00.1 (or later) in the standard
        repositories, so the easiest method of installation is using
        <code>pacman</code>:
      </p><pre id="idp12673984">
$ pacman -Sy ocaml
</pre></section><section><h1 id="windows">Windows</h1><p id="idp12675904">
        Windows is not currently supported by the examples in Real World
        OCaml, although it is being worked on. Until that's ready, we
        recommend using a virtual machine running Debian Linux on your
        local machine.
      </p></section><section><h1 id="building-from-source">Building from source</h1><p id="idp12677712">
        To install OCaml from source code, first make sure that you have
        a C compilation environment (usually either
        <code>gcc</code> or <code>llvm</code> installed).
      </p><pre id="idp12679696">
$ curl -OL https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/trunk.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf trunk.tar.gz
$ cd ocaml-trunk
$ ./configure
$ make world world.opt
$ sudo make install
</pre><p id="idp12680528">
        The final step requires administrator privilege to install in
        your system directory. You can also install it in your home
        directory by passing the <code>prefix</code> option to the
        configuration script:
      </p><pre id="idp12681856">
$ ./configure -prefix $HOME/my-ocaml
</pre><p id="idp12682560">
        Once the installation is completed into this custom location,
        you will need to add <code>$HOME/my-ocaml/bin</code> to
        your <code>PATH</code>, normally by editing the
        <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file. You shouldn't really to
        do this unless you have special reasons, so try to install
        binary packages before trying a source installation.

      OPAM manages multiple simultaneous OCaml compiler and library
      installations, tracks library versions across upgrades, and
      recompiles dependencies automatically if they get out of date.
      It's used throughout Real World OCaml as the mechanism to retrieve
      and use third-party libraries.

      Before installing OPAM, make sure that you have the OCaml compiler
      installed as described above. Once installed, the entire OPAM
      database is held in your home directory (normally
      <code>$HOME/.opam</code>). If something goes wrong, just
      delete this <code>.opam</code> directory and start over from
      a clean slate. If youre using a beta version of OPAM, please

$ eval `opam config -env`
</pre><p id="idp12726656">
      This evaluates the results of running
      <code>opam config env</code> in your current shell, and sets
      the variables so that subsequent commands will use them. This only
      works with your current shell, and it can be automated for all
      future shells by adding the line to your login scripts. On Mac OS
      X or Debian, this is usually the
      <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file if you're using the
      default shell. If you've switched to another shell, it might be
      <code>~/.zshrc</code> instead. OPAM isn't unusual in this
      approach; the SSH <code>ssh-agent</code> also works
      similarly, so if you're having any problems just hunt around in
      your configuration scripts to see how that's being invoked.
    </p><p id="idp12730528">
      If you answered <code>yes</code> to the auto-complete
      scripts question during <code>opam init</code>, this should
      have all been set up for you. You can verify this worked by
      listing the available packages:
    </p><pre id="idp12732544">
$ opam list
</pre><aside class="note"><h1>
    Note to reviewers
    </h1><p id="idp12733920">
      OPAM 1.0.0 places the login commands into your
      <code>~/.profile</code> directory, which isn't always
      executed if your shell is <code>bash</code>. This has been
      fixed in subsequent versions, but for now you'll need to manually
      copy the contents of <code>~/.profile</code> over to
      <code>~/.bash_profile</code> via:
    </p><pre id="idp12737408">
$ cat ~/.profile &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</pre></aside><p id="idp12738240">
      The most important package we need to install is Core, which is
      the replacement standard library that all of the examples in this
      book use. Before doing this, let's make sure you have exactly the
      right compiler version you need. We've made some minor
      modifications to the way the OCaml compiler displays type
      signatures, and the next command will install a patched
      <code>4.01.0</code> compiler with this functionality
      enabled.
    </p><pre id="idp12739808">
$ opam switch 4.01.0dev+trunk
</pre><p id="idp12740512">
      This step will take about 5-10 minutes on a modern machine, and
      will download and install (within the <code>~/.opam</code>
      directory) a custom OCaml compiler. OPAM supports multiple such
      installations, and you'll find this very useful if you ever decide
      to hack on the internals of the compiler itself, or you want to
      experiment with the latest release without sacrificing your
      current installation. You only need to install this compiler once,
      and future updates will be much faster as they only recompile
      libraries within the compiler installation.
    </p><p id="idp12742208">
      The new compiler will be installed into
      <code>~/.opam/4.01.0dev+trunk</code> and any libraries you
      install for it will be tracked separately from your system
      installation. You can have any number of compilers installed
      simultaneously, but only one can be active at any time. Browse
      through the available compilers by running
      <code>opam switch list</code>.
    </p><p id="idp12744352">
      Finally, we're ready to install the Core libraries. Run this:
    </p><pre id="idp12744832">
$ opam install core core_extended async
</pre><p id="idp12745552">
      This will take about five or ten minutes to build, and will
      install a series of packages. OPAM figures out the dependencies
      you need automatically, but the three packages that really matter
      are:
    </p><ul><li><p id="idp12746688">
<code>core</code> is the main, well-supported Core
          distribution from Jane Street.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp12748240">
<code>core_extended</code> contains a number of
          experimental, but useful, extension libraries that are under
          review for inclusion in Core. We use some of these in places,
          but much less than Core itself.
        </p></li><li><p id="idp12749920">
<code>async</code> is the network programming library
          that we use in Part II to communicate with other hosts. You
          can skip this for the initial installation until you get to
          Part II, if you prefer.
        </p></li></ul><section><h1 id="editing-environment">Editing Environment</h1><p id="idp12752640">
        There's one last tool you need before getting started on the
        examples. The default <code>ocaml</code> command gives us
        an interactive command-line to experiment with code without
        compiling it. However, it's quite a spartan experience and so we
        use a more modern alternative.
      </p><pre id="idp12754048">
$ opam install utop
</pre><p id="idp12754736">
        The <code>utop</code> package is an interactive
        command-line interface to OCaml that has tab-completion,
        persistent history and integration with Emacs so that you can
        run it within your editing environment.
      </p><p id="idp12756080">
        Remember from earlier that OPAM never installs files directly
        into your system directories, and this applies to
        <code>utop</code> too. You'll find the binary in
        <code>~/.opam/4.01.0dev+trunk/bin</code>. However, just
        typing in <code>utop</code> from your shell should just
        work, due to the <code>opam config env</code> step that
        configures your shell. Don't forget to automate this as
        described earlier, as it makes life much easier when developing
        OCaml code!
      </p></section><section><h1 id="command-line">Command Line</h1><p id="idp12760992">
        The <code>utop</code> tool provides a convenient
        interactive toplevel, with full command history, command macros
        and module name completion. When you first run
        <code>utop</code>, you'll find yourself at an interactive
        prompt with a bar at the bottom of the screen. The bottom bar
        dynamically updates as you write text, and contains the possible
        names of modules or variables that are valid at that point in
        the phrase you are entering. You can press the
        <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key to complete the phrase with
        the first choice.
      </p><p id="idp12764064">
        The <code>~/.ocamlinit</code> file in your home directory
        initialises <code>utop</code> with common libraries and
        syntax extensions so you don't need to type them in every time.
        Now that you have Core installed, you should update it to load
        it every time you start <code>utop</code>, by adding this
        to it:
      </p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">use</span> <span class="s2">&quot;topfind&quot;</span>
<span class="o">#</span><span class="n">camlp4o</span>

<span class="o">#</span><span class="n">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;core.syntax&quot;</span>
<span class="o">#</span><span class="n">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;core_extended&quot;</span>
<span class="o">#</span><span class="n">require</span> <span class="s2">&quot;async&quot;</span>
<span class="k">open</span> <span class="nn">Core</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Std</span>
</pre></div><p id="idp12767984">
        When you run <code>utop</code> with this initialization
        file, it should start up with Core opened and ready to use.

          To use <code>utop</code> directly in Emacs, add the
          following line to your <code>~/.emacs</code> file:
        </p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">autoload</span> <span class="ss">'utop</span> <span class="s">&quot;utop&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Toplevel for OCaml&quot;</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div><p id="idp12775712">
          You also need to make the <code>utop.el</code> file
          available to your Emacs installation. The OPAM version of
          <code>utop</code> installs it into the
          <code>~/.opam</code> hierarchy, for example in
          <code>~/.opam/system/share/emacs/site-lisp/utop.el</code>.
          You may need to replace <code>system</code> with your
          current compiler switch, such as
          <code>4.01.0dev+trunk</code>.
        </p><p id="idp12780656">
          Once this successfully loads in Emacs, you can run utop by
          executing the command <code>utop</code> in Emacs. There
          are more details instructions at the
