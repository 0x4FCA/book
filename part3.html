<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" data-type="part"><h1>The Runtime System</h1><p>Writing good OCaml code is only one half of the typical software engineering
      workflowâ€”you also need to understand how OCaml executes this code, and how to debug and
      profile your production applications. Part III is thus all about understanding the compiler
      toolchain and runtime system in OCaml. It is a remarkably simple system in comparison to other
      language runtimes such as Java or the .NET CLR, so this chapter should be accessible to even
      the casual OCaml programmer.</p><p>We open by a guided tour through the Ctypes library for binding your OCaml code to
      foreign C libraries. We use a terminal interface and POSIX functions of increasing complexity
      to show the more advanced features of the library.</p><p>OCaml has a very predictable memory representation of values, which we explain in the next
      chapter by walking through the various datatypes. We then illustrate how the memory regions in
      OCaml are automatically managed by a garbage collector to ensure no memory leaks occur.</p><p>The part closes with two bigger chapters that explain the tools that comprise the OCaml
      compiler, breaking it up into two logical pieces. The first part covers the parser and type
      checker and highlights various tips to help you solve common problems in your source code. The
      second part covers code generation into bytecode and native code, and also explains how to
      debug and profile production binaries.</p></div>
