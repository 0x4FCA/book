* Chapter proposals

Some other thoughts for chapters to add:

** Designing modules

Maybe a section on design tips for OCaml.  Suggestions on idioms like
signature includes; conventions on naming functions; suggestions about
building useful abstractions.

Maybe also some clever type-design tricks should be included:
type-indexed values and phantom types come up from time to time, and
are pretty handy.

** Unicode

Maybe a chapter on how to use Unicode effectively in OCaml?  I've
never done this, so I'm not the best person.  But it does seem like a
common enough issue.
