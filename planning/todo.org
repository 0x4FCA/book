* Fixes to Core
** Install top-level printers for more types (Error, for one)
** Improve Core's documentation.
*** Have a front-page for the documentation
** Improve bin-prot's usability in the non-async world?
** Fix inconsistency of sexp_option and sexp_list
** Make fieldslib respect private record types
 (i.e., no map, no set_XXX)
** Fix display of non-sexp'd exceptions
 Right now, when we have Core's pretty-printers turned on, a bare
 exception is reported as follows:

    Exception: ("Key_not_found(\"c\")").

 which is pretty nasty.
