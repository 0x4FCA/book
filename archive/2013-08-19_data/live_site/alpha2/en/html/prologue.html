<span><em>(yminsky: this is something of a placeholder. We need a

      Programming languages matter.
    </p><p id="idp3860896">
      The programming languages that you use affect your productivity.
      They affect how reliable your software is, how efficient it is,
      how easy it is to read, to refactor, and to extend. And the
      programming languages you know and use can deeply affect how you
      think about programming and software design.
    </p><p id="idp3248944">
      But not all ideas about how to design a programming language are
      created equal. Over the last 40 years, a few key language features
      have emerged that together form a kind of sweet-spot in language
      design. These features include:
    </p><ul><li><p id="idp2674784">
          Garbage collection
        </p></li><li><p id="idp3447104">
          First-class and higher-order functions
        </p></li><li><p id="idp3591184">
          Static type-checking
        </p></li><li><p id="idp1745904">
          Parametric polymorphism
        </p></li><li><p id="idp2730080">
          Support for programming with immutable values
        </p></li><li><p id="idp4053264">
          Algebraic datatypes and pattern-matching
        </p></li><li><p id="idp2764784">
          Type inference
        </p></li></ul><p id="idp2983984">
      Some of these features you already know and love, and some are
      probably new to you. But as we hope to demonstrate over the course
      of this book, it turns out that there is something transformative
      about having them all together and able to interact with each
      other in a single language.
    </p><p id="idp3313696">
      Despite their importance, these ideas have made only limited
      inroads into mainstream languages. And when they do arrive there,
      like higher-order functions in C# or parametric polymorphism in
      Java, it's typically in a limited and awkward form. The only
      languages that support these ideas well are statically-typed
      functional programming languages like OCaml, F#, Haskell, Scala
      and Standard-ML.
    </p><p id="idp3447872">
      Among this worthy set of languages, OCaml stands apart because it
      manages to provide a great deal of power while remaining highly
      pragmatic, highly performant, and comparatively simple to use and
      understand. It is this that makes OCaml a great choice for
      programmers who want to step up to a better programming language,
      and at the same time want to get practical work done.
    </p></section><section><h1 id="why-core">Why Core?</h1><p id="idp4132128">
      A language on its own isn't enough. You also need a rich set of
      libraries to base your applications on. A common source of
      frustration for those learning OCaml is that the standard library
      that ships with the OCaml compiler is not ideal. While it's well
      implemented, it covers only a small subset of the functionality
      you expect from a standard library, and the interfaces are
      idiosyncratic and inconsistent.
    </p><p id="idp198032">
      But all is not lost! There is an effective alternative to the
      OCaml standard library called Core. Jane Street, a company that
      has been using OCaml for nearly a decade, developed Core for its
      own internal use, but it was designed from the start with an eye
      towards being a general-purpose standard library. Core is also
      distributed with syntax-extensions which provide essential new
      functionality to OCaml; and there are additional libraries, like
      Core_extended and Async, that provide even more useful
      functionality.
    </p><p id="idp300720">
      We believe that Core makes OCaml a better tool, and that's why
      we'll present OCaml and Core together.
