* Overview
** Background/Goals
 The tutorial is aimed at people with some background in functional
 programming, including those with no specific background in OCaml, to
 those who know OCaml, but are are interested in learning about newer
 tools and libraries, including:

 - opam
 - Core
 - Async/LWT

 The tutorial will work through real-world examples, including build
 system on up to deploying an opam package.
** Requirements
 At a minimum, participants should have a laptop with a terminal
 application and SSH client.  Participants with Linux, FreeBSD or
 MacOS will be able to install the software on their own machines.  A
 server will be provided for those who for whatever reason can't
 install the necessary software on their own machine.
