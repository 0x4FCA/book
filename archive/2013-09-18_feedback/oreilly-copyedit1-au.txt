Page 15: AU: Adding commas will help readability here. Is "polymorphic methods, variants, and labeled and optional arguments" OK?
AR: yes

Page 16: AU: Since you've already italicized "utop" earlier in this paragraph, there's no need to do so again.
AR: we are just using the <command> tag here -- isn't that ok?

Page 16: AU: Is the hyphen part of the term? Normally we wouldn't use one between an adverb and the word it modifies.
AR: we can refer to this without the hyphen too: "statically typed"

Page 20: AU: Forthcoming, in parentheses) is how the Chicago Manual of Style suggests wording a not-yet-published book that is under contract. Is that the case?
AR: this book is not currently under contract and isn't forthcoming -- it's simply available on the web as a draft.

Page 21: AU: Previously, this term was lowercase. OK?
AR: this should also be <command> in the DocBook I think, since it's referring to a command line.

Page 25: AU: Since you've already italicized "utop," there's no need to do it again, so put the following terms in roman. Unless there's another reason for the font.
AR: using <command> in DocBook.  I wonder if we've done this wrong.

Page 29: AU: Please turn this into a numbered list.
AR: since this is a step-by-step process, this makes sense

Page 35: AU: Should the languages be in constant width?
AR: Good catch -- they should not be in constant width

Page 35: AU: For ease of reading, I would not have a fragment followed by a complete sentence in parentheses. How about, "...patterns, separated by |'s. (The one before the first case is optional.)" ?
AR: Yes, your rewording is better than the existing prose.

Page 36: AU: Is the comma part of the code? If not, I would lose it to avoid confusion.
AR: the comma is not part of the code, and therefore can be removed.

Page 45: AU: constant width
AR: Yes, the "ref" should be constant width

Page 45: AU: constant width
AR: Yes, the "ref" should be constant width

Page 45: AU: constant width
AR: Yes, the "ref" should be constant width

Page 45: AU: OK that the loops aren't in constant width?
AR: "for" and "while" are keywords, and so should be constant width

Page 47: AU: No italics.
AR: See <command> confusion above in previous utop uses

Page 47: AU: Files should be italicized instead of in constant width.
AR: Yes, this should be a <filename> tag in Docbook

Page 49: AU: No italics.
AR: See previous comment about utop

Page 50: AU: In the last chapter, you spelled "toplevel," when used as a noun, like that. Just checking that that's the standard spelling so that I can make the word consistent throughout the book.
AR: we use "toplevel" in preference to "top level", so making the former consistent would be great

Page 52: AU: In this chapter, you've hyphenated and not hyphenated this phrase. How would you like it to appear throughout the book?
AR: it would be best to make it "<fixed>let</fixed> binding", since let is a keyword

Page 52: AU: Since in the code, the compound is closed, is it OK to keep it closed in the regular text?
AR: yes, thats fine

Page 58: AU: Typo?
AR: that should be "or" as a keyword

Page 58: AU: constant width?
AR: yes, should be constant width

Page 63: AU: constant width?
AR: yes, should be constant width

Page 81: AU: "pattern"?
AR: "pattern" is indeed correct

Page 89: AU: If this is a file name, please italicize.
AR: yes, this is a file name

Page 91: AU: Is the noun form hyphenated? It makes sense that the adjectival form would be.
AR: I agree with you; it should not be hyphenated in its noun form

Page 92: AU: Here, the noun form is open, so that's why I asked about the hyphenation earlier. Also, please caps once we decide on which way to punctuate.
AR: open seems correct for the noun form

Page 93: AU: Filenames should be italicized instead of in constant width.
AR: agreed

Page 95: AU: constant width?
AR: yes, should be constant width

Page 120: AU: Italicize whole phrase.

AR: agreed

Page 233: AU: Please turn into variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 255: AU: Typo?
AR: are you referring to the quotes? not sure here.

Page 271: AU: "their side effects"?
AR: yes, this is a typo

Page 272: AU: Please turn into variable list. 
AR: agreed

Page 287: AU: Incomplete thought?
AR: "essentially" can be dropped

Page 287: AU: Incomplete?
AR: e.g. can be dropped

Page 295: AU: Turn into variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 312: AU: No italics.
AR: this was using <command> again

Page 312: AU: File names should be in italics, not constant width.

AR: see 312 comment

Page 314: AU: Please turn into variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 318: AU: File names should be in italics.
AR: see 312 comment

Page 324: AU: Please make variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 327: AU: Did you mean to use "and"?
AR: yes, "and" would be better here

Page 328: AU: Convert to variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 334: AU: No italics necessary in this section.
AR: this is using <command> again

Page 352: AU: The following syntaxes should be defined through a variable list to ease of reading.
AR: this is currently a definitionlist, but we dont mind changing it if you think it's better as a variable list

Page 352: AU: "open parentheses"?
AR: yes, that sounds better than the contraction

Page 364: AU: No italics.
AR: 

Page 374: AU: Make sure colon is not in constant width.
AR: agreed

Page 375: AU: Turn into variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 377: AU: Colon shouldn't be in constant width.
AR: agreed

Page 383: AU: "; instead use functions"?
AR: yes, this is a typo and "use" is correct as you suggest

Page 383: AU: I would just start a new sentence here.
AR: agreed

Page 385: AU: Does "concurrent" make "in the same program" repetitive here?
AR: it does, but it's an important distinction that the subexpressions are also concurrent. Leave as-is

Page 387: AU: Make sure colon not on constant width.
AR: agreed

Page 391: AU: Consider rewriting to avoid repetitive "follow."
AR: could be changed to "if you ensure that:"

Page 402: AU: Put in variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 427: AU: Please use variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 433: AU: Apostrophe should be going the other way.
AR: agreed

Page 435: AU: Are you referring to the code here?
AR: referring to the note below on "controlling major heap allocations".  This is not reflected in the text though, as you point out...

Page 445: AU: The following bullets should be turned into a variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 445: AU: The following should also be a variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 450: AU: Please turn into variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 456: AU: Please put the following terms and definitions in a variable list.
AR: agreed

Page 458: AU: Should this be capitalized?
AR: nope, this is not referring to the Core library, but the vanilla language itself

Page 465: AU: Could you look at this sentence again and rework it so there's parallel structure? The "but still compile" is where it starts to diverge.
AR: this would be clearer by removing "and version control" (editing covers version control)

Page 473: AU: Since "bytecode" and "native code" have been spelled differently so far in this chapter, I just wanted to know which way you wanted to go: hyphen or no hyphen, space or no space.
AR: "bytecode" and "native code" are appropriate -- its a little odd that bytecode isnt "byte code", but its most often referred to as bytecode in the wider literature.

Page 478: AU: "Tool-chain" has also been spelled differently throughout the book, so let me know how you want it.
AR: we're happy with O'Reilly house style here.  Toolchain seems better to me though.
