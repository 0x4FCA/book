a. Looks very nice. 

b. Is the copyright discussion ("using code examples") yours or
   standard o'reilly? I kind of like it.

c. Looked at it briefly and can't help myself but must make
   small-minded editing comments:

p. 5 "This chapter is going to give an overview" -- tighten to "This
   chapter will give an overview" or "This chapter gives an overview".

p. 6 third bullet: the word "parens" is not really English... I know
   you are aiming at a technical audience but still.

p. 7 middle "...OCaml is able to determine the type... using a
   technique called type-inference, by which it infers the type..."
   seems a bit roundabout!

p. 7 near bottom "Indeed, it seems like.... Indeed, if we look..."
   could use editing.

p. 8 third example is actually mis-chosen: its problem is not that it
   mixes two types in first_if_true, but that it feeds the wrong type
   to big_number.

   I think you must have meant to give something like first_if_true
   big_number 17 "loooong";;

That's all for now. I quite like the guided tour. It makes very good
choices about what details to focus on and what to leave out.
