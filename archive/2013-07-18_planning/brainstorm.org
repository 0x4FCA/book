* FCM examples
** modules-as-integers
 - Utterly trivial
 - But does show the basic mechanics
** File_descr_watcher
 - A highly realistic example
 - But a bit obscure, down at the base of some complicated stack
** Service bundle
 - I hate this example more the more I look at it.
 - That said, it does make some use of FCMs, and it has a neat demo
 - But no real use of existentials.
** Machine learning library
** /proc
** Crypto math
** Rendering back-end
 - Stolen from the manual
 - But still: a cool example, and one that is really meaningful.
 - Implementing the SVG version of this is going to be real work I
   don't want to do.
** Data-stream front-end
** Container
** Logging system
** Plug-in system
